</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_0_7 c008'>Most of the following is true,
or founded on truth. A few
are waifs—products of my
imagination; little stories that came into
my mind from time to time. Some of
them are from letters written home
while I was confined in the Tombs
Prison in New York City, and in the
Death-Chamber at Sing Sing.</p>

<p class='c009'>In them I have not inflicted myself
to any great extent upon the reader.
Herein is chiefly what I saw when trying
to look upon the bright side. There
are also glimpses of the side which cannot
be made bright, look at it as one
may.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>But if anything in these pages leads
some one to think of what must be endured
in either place, let me say, that
no suffering was ever willingly caused
by the officials with whom I came in
contact during my “banishment,” and
I take this opportunity to thank them all,
without exception, for their consideration,
sympathy, and unvarying kindness
to me and mine.</p>

<div>
  <h2 id='ch1' class='c011'><i>CHAPTER I</i><br /> <br /><span class='under'><i><span class='small'>The Room with the Little Door</span></i></span></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_0_7 c008'>There are few who can describe
life in the Death-Chamber
at Sing Sing. The officials
can, but will not. Visitors there
are few; and most of us who know it
so well, come and go like our predecessors,
saying nothing afterwards about
our experiences, for an excellent reason.</p>

<p class='c009'>The corridor in the Death-Chamber
is not large. Ten cells for the
condemned men face it, most of them
on one side. Their inmates are not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>supposed to see much of each other.
When one of our number walks in the
corridor for exercise, curtains are drawn
down in front of all the cells, and we
see upon them what our fellow-inmate
often resembles—a shadow. A shadow,
and a voice which calls to us, that is his
identity. There are no windows in
these cells; three sides are solid wall;
their fronts face the corridor, and are
barred like cages. In them one can
easily imagine himself a bear in a menagerie,
even to the sore head that animal
is afflicted with more or less occasionally.
In front of the bars and
curtains are wire nettings to keep
our visitors from coming too near us.
There are no hand-clasps, no kisses.
The corridor and cells constitute the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>Death-Chamber. It has two doors;
an entrance—few of the condemned
ever use that door for any other purpose;
and an exit—a final one—leading
into the Execution Room and to the
“Chair.”</p>

<p class='c009'>It is very light indeed in the Death-Chamber.
Glass skylights by day, and
gas and electric light by night, throw
their beams into every corner of our
cages of steel and stone. There is no
privacy. The guards pace up and down
night and day, always watching. There
is no sound while they do this, as their
shoes, like ours, are soled with felt. It
is like living, eating, sleeping, and bathing
in a search-light. It is like being
alive, yet buried in a glass coffin. We
enter the front door; exist for a year or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>so, and then go out through the “little
door,” as we call it, some morning to a
very welcome release. From the moment
we arrive the monotony begins,
and continues always, broken now and
then by such excitement as a half hour’s
exercise in the corridor, the weekly bath
and shave, and, best of all, a visit, which
must be from some member of our immediate
family. We see our guest
through those miserable bars and netting
which divide us. A keeper must
hear everything we say. These things
are all that ever happen in that chamber
of death, except greeting new arrivals,
and saying good-by now and then
to a fellow we have suffered with. No
newspapers come to us, but books from
the excellent library, as many as one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>wants, are supplied. We receive our
mail after it has been opened and read,
provided it is thought proper for us to
have it. If the letter contains the news
we are all awaiting—the final news—it
is improper. That information is
kept from one as long as possible. All
the tobacco is provided. It is called
“State.” It puts you in a “state”
when you first attempt to smoke it.
No clock ticks in that room, and none
is needed, because the value of time
and its relation to affairs is eliminated.
Enough for us in there that it is either
day or night. What do we care about
the hour? To us time is just an endless
waiting without expectancy. Imagine
it for yourself. Each second seems an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>hour long—and we are kept in there for
years.</p>

<p class='c009'>This is the life we lead, and who would
care to speak or write of such an existence?
Is there anything to tell about
this living death—this sort of noiseless
purgatory in which, as the months go
by, past experiences, the hopes and
fears and happinesses which were, grow
fainter and fainter, till, like the future,
they inspire us with nothing but indifference,
leaving only the present to be
endured?</p>

<p class='c009'>Yet there is one thing here which
interests us intensely; which is before
us all the time, and which some day will
close behind us. On one side is life—such
as it is—on the other instant death.</p>

<p class='c009'>To pass through will be an experience
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>surely. It is seldom opened; I
have observed it so just seven times;
but when it is ajar—things happen.
Whenever we look out of our cages we
see it; we close our eyes—we still see
it. When exercising in the corridor
one passes and repasses it; though
we walk away, we know we are going
towards it. Thinking by day and
dreaming by night, it is always with
us, and irresistible is its fascination.
All else here is insignificant; and to us
the Death-Chamber is but “The Room
with the Little Door.”</p>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_0_7 c008'>It would seem impossible for any
one to escape from the Death-Chamber.
But there is a story
of one man who refused to stay, and
who, under the very eyes of his keepers,
without any privacy or apparatus, manufactured
the poison with which he ended
his life; for that is almost the only way
you can end your stay in the Death-Chamber.</p>

<p class='c009'>The man’s crime, his history, does not
affect this story, but his personality does.
He was the quietest man of all; and men
who are waiting death are usually quiet
men. A German by nationality, very
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>gentle, almost affectionate one would
think, from the fact that he caught
and tamed a small mouse to which he
seemed devoted. Now a mouse is a
rare thing within the precinct of which
I speak, for stone and steel do not offer
it the crevices it affects. But the
German—he was called “Professor”
because he wore glasses—had asked
when he arrived if any mice had been
tamed. “You can teach them tricks,”
he said. He used to sleep all day, and
at night very patiently lay and watched
the bread crumbs he scattered on the
floor. He did this for months; and at
last the great event occurred. Can you
guess what he used for a trap? His
stocking. He did teach the mouse
tricks. He taught it to eat meat out
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>of his hand, which was not difficult, and
to come when he called, which was. It
slept with him. This took patience.
Remember, he had no string with which
to tie it, and had to keep it under his
drinking cup at first to prevent its running
away.</p>

<p class='c009'>Time went by. Winter changed to
summer, and with that season came a
letter to the “Professor” and a death
warrant to the warden. This was for
the “Professor” also; that is, it was to
be read to him, and—was it sympathy, or
what? Death came to the little mouse
at that time. I suppose that every man
would confess that it is disturbing to receive
the news that he must go through
the “little door” in the Death-Chamber
into the beyond, and so it affected
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>the “Professor,” philosopher though he
undoubtedly was. Perhaps it was not
the news, but the loss of his little friend;
perhaps it was both; at any rate the
“Professor” took to his bed. The
prison doctor came, winked at the
keeper, and said, “Fright; let him
alone.” So they let the “Professor”
alone, and the “Professor” died; but
when they went into the cell, they
found the cause of his illness had not
been fright at all. It was erysipelas.
Over his breast were long scratches,
deep as little teeth could make them
(we have no pins in the Death-Chamber),
and flattened down on them and
tightly bound lay the putrid remains of
“the little dead mouse.”</p>

  <h2 id='ch3' class='c011'><i>CHAPTER III</i><br /> <br /><span class='under'><i><span class='small'>A Forbidden Song</span></i></span></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_0_7 c008'>Sometimes in the evenings, the
Death-Chamber seemed quite
a different place, and we all forgot
our <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>ennui</i></span> because some one started
a song. I have heard good singing
there, and some of us understood music.
So when “Eddy,” with his really good
tenor, would start up something we all
knew, books would close and pipes go
out, and we all would join in and sing
ourselves out of the blues.</p>

<p class='c009'>What did we sing? Everything, from
“America,” with special gusto at the
“Sweet land of liberty” part, to the
last popular song whose strains had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>been wafted to our “desert island.”
How we sang! When we could not remember
or did not know the words
we sang on just the same. Hours have
actually speeded that way, when we happened
to be in the mood, and we were
all the better for it. Did I say we
sang everything? No, not everything.
There were strong men there, determined
men, who had done and would
do desperate things. But there was
one song ever in our minds and in our
hearts that never came to our lips, and
which not one of us would have dared
even to hum. Not a voice could have
trembled through had it started. Every
one thought of it; no one ever suggested
it. You know the one I mean.</p>

<p class='c009'>One night when we were through an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>especially good concert (I had sung a
solo) some one shouted out “Police!”
Now, of course, not one of us wanted
to have anything further to do with
that department. It was only our way
of calling for a “light.” We have
no matches in the Death-Chamber;
there is phosphorus in them, and you
might—. So when George, our keeper,
had come to my cage with the burning
paper spill, and when my pipe was going
cheerfully, I said: “George, music
certainly does affect the emotions, but
under some circumstances, I imagine,
it could make one quite blue. Did you
ever notice that?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I should say so,” was the reply. “I
remember once starting a song here that
was never finished for that same reason.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>“What was it?” said I, turning away,
for I knew the answer before it came.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It was ---- ---- ----.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Damn this tobacco! the smoke gets
into my eyes.”</p>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_0_7 c008'>No newspapers were allowed
in the Death-Chamber,
therefore the longing for
them among its inmates may be imagined.
But the law that supply always
follows demand, was operative even
within the walls of the “dead house,”
and properly so; for had we not all become
intimately acquainted with Law?
Therefore we had a newspaper of our
own.</p>

<p class='c009'>Let me tell you of the happy days
(happily past) when I was editor-in-chief
and proprietor of “The Murderers’
Home Journal,” sometimes lovingly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>referred to as “The Dead House
Squealer.” The public will never turn
over a file of its pages, but they may
read here some extracts from its columns.
As to the paper itself, it was
as artistic as black and blue pencils
could make it. We all contributed what
and when we pleased. It appeared when
convenient, and as nothing was charged
for advertisements or subscriptions, no
wonder it prospered. Every one in our
community read it and read no other.
It contained real poetry, jokes—what
jokes!—essays on our neighbors’ behavior,
and news—<em>local</em> news, together
with advertisements which simply compelled
attention. The letters therein to
the editor-in-chief left nothing to the
imagination. And the leaders—ah, I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>wrote them! How proudly I referred
to myself as “we”! Sometimes I used
a pencil almost as blue as myself, never
a pen—a vein can be opened with a pen.</p>

<p class='c009'>Every proprietor admires and praises
his own publication, and I shall proceed
to “Munsey” mine. I can say
without egotism, since it is but imperfectly
expressed justice, that there has
never been another newspaper “approaching”
it. “Old Sol” does not
affect the Death-Chamber; no sun
shone on it, so of course we could not
“see it in the ‘Sun’”; but we were as
up to date in our own affairs as the
“Times” permitted, as sensational in
local matters as all the “yellows” combined;
nothing in the “World” got
ahead of our “Journal” in this respect.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>Having no “News” we invented it,
just as do the newspapers for which
you pay, but we never had to take anything
back. The “Tribune” from
which it issued was my cage, and I, the
editor-in-chief, remained as deaf as a
“Post” to all abuse (I am used to it).
As for a “Press,” we had none. It
was printed by my tired fingers. The
illustrations were alluring, and though
we received neither “Telegram” nor
“Mail and Express,” yet we never forgot
a text to “Herald” our first column.
It was always the same one—“Damn
the Jury.” Its politics were
“sound.” (All politics are that.) We
opposed the government with a capital
O, and that institution responded
with the only practical solution for restraining
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>the license of modern journalism—it
killed the editors. I can truthfully
say that it cost me a great deal
of money to escape even as far as the
“Tombs.” Many of my unfortunate
associates have also “passed away” to
similar places, and I wish some reporters
I know of could be assigned to
interview them.</p>

<p class='c009'>I pass over all the local news which
appeared in the “Murderers’ Home
Journal.” Such announcements as
“John, the Greek, has come back for
nineteen years—foolish John!” “Bill
Newfeldt caught a mouse in his sock
last night—poor thing!” Such as the
above, and the chronicled fact that Doctor
Sam’s office hours in the morning
were from twelve <span class='fss'>A.M.</span> to twelve <span class='fss'>P.M.</span>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>and in the afternoon from twelve <span class='fss'>P.M.</span>
to twelve <span class='fss'>A.M.</span> (in spite of this he had
no “patients”), or a brilliantly worded
“ad” advising the reader to take “Molineux’s
Bromo-Seltzer”; all these were
replete with absorbing interest to us,
but not to you.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was when the “divine afflatus”
came upon us, as had the influenza
the month previous—we all had it—that
you might be interested. Many and
varied were the verses that deluged the
editorial sanctum; jingles, triolets, lyrics,
epigrams, and of course the very
first offered was—there, you have
guessed it—“Spring.” I give it just
as it came to me, leaving it for you to
decide whether it be humorous or pitiful.</p>

<p class='c009'>In an early issue a gem of an epigram
appeared, and straightway epigrams became
the mode—we all affected them.
The vogue was hard while it lasted.
A dozen times a day I was assured over
the wireless telephone (Nature’s) that
Bill or Mike or another had a “bird”
for the next issue. Here are some of
them.</p>

<p class='c009'>This one was the “first offence.” If
you like it, it is mine; but of course if
any one is going to get mad about it,
then another fellow, one of the dead
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>ones, was its author. Is not its sentiment
exquisite?</p>

<h3 class='c012'>AN EPITAPH WHICH CANNOT BE USED TOO SOON.</h3>

<div class='lg-container-b c000'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Here lies a judge, whose last words I indite:</div>
      <div class='line'>“I’ll go to Heaven—I’ll go this very night.”</div>
      <div class='line'>He died as with himself he yet conversed;</div>
      <div class='line'><em>As usual</em>—his decision was reversed.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Another of great beauty and singularly
apt. I have a shrewd suspicion
that it refers to the same person:</p>

<h3 class='c012'>TO A VERY LEARNED JUDGE.</h3>

<div class='lg-container-b c000'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>His Honor is wrong, in error, unwise.</div>
      <div class='line'>He blunders in every case that he tries;</div>
      <div class='line'>With “Wisdom” he will not compromise.</div>
      <div class='line'>So I asked him the reason why.</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>The judge replied, after due reflection,</div>
      <div class='line'>“To ‘Wisdom’ I have a good objection:</div>

      <div class='line'>“I agree with you,” said I.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Still another, evidently referring to
the same respected jurist. It is a lofty
and improving message from the Bench.
I am very partial to this one:</p>

<h3 class='c012'>HEARD IN COURT.</h3>

<div class='lg-container-b c000'>

      <div class='line'>I mean that I said, No. Yes, Yes! I did not.</div>
      <div class='line'>Then I will charge it. What? My meaning hid?</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>My former rulings? I forget them, curse it!</div>
      <div class='line'>My opinion is not quite clear, and I reverse it!</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Modesty restrains me from mentioning
the author of this glittering example
of pure idealism:</p>

<h3 class='c012'>THE COLONEL.</h3>

<div class='lg-container-b c000'>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>After a certain assistant district attorney,
noted for his verboseness, had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>made his closing argument, the jury
convicted the composer of this couplet.
He seems to resent it:</p>

<h3 class='c012'>THE JURY.</h3>

<div class='lg-container-b c000'>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>To an assistant district attorney who
proved nothing but his own desire for
notoriety and his ability to make a noise
and keep the Court of Appeals busy.
Those who heard him sum up the first
important case he ever had, and the
one on which rests his reputation (for
brutality and unfairness), may remember
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>and see the application to a certain

      <div class='line'>He persecutes the charming “Bell,”</div>

      <div class='line'>With clamorous lies he “told” this “knell,”</div>
      <div class='line'>Produce, produce, produce the—“ring.”</div>
    </div>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_0_7 c008'>The Death-Chamber is well
worth studying. Our community
is certainly interesting.
Already I have made a discovery.
Every one of us is busy. Here are
many languages, temperaments, and
moods, but we all have our fancies and
our fads.</p>

<p class='c009'>For instance, there is the Italian next
door who makes gorgeous picture
frames from scraps of paper, decorating
them with colored pencils; these are
considerately furnished by the State to
prevent him from going crazy. His
creations are wonderful, and as his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>mood at present is devoutly religious,
his cage looks like a cathedral. Many
are the saints that smile benignly and
beckon hospitably; and yet Larry does
not want to join them.</p>

<p class='c009'>The religious mood is usually the
last of a progression beginning with
despair. It is in the latter frame of
mind that new arrivals appear. Then
there is the studious period, with which
I struggle just now, when one reads a
great deal and works out chess problems
with bits of paper on a home-made
board.</p>

<p class='c009'>Yes, I read incessantly, often under
difficulties. Recently I had selected
“Paradise Lost.” Ah, it was a venerable
tome—ragged and bethumbed;
dog-eared and tattered was that volume
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>in the Sing Sing prison library. I believe
its back was also broken. Many
cells had it visited. Apparently it was
appreciated by the inhabitants thereof.
Poor creatures, they too had lost their
paradise; but, alas, others had found it—and
had moved into the book itself—generations
of them! I perused Milton’s
matchless epic. The stately iambus,
the exceptional trochee, dactyl, amphibrach,
and anapest rolled and sang
solemn music in my soul. I read:</p>
<div class='lg-container-b c000'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in20'>“Thus they,</div>
      <div class='line'>Breathing united force, with fixèd thought,</div>
      <div class='line'>Moved on in silence----”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>What is that! What <em>is</em> that!! On
my wrist, up my arm! Another, another!
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>Not <em>that</em>, but <em>those</em>—the myriad
hosts of Apollyon’s army. They were
starved, <em>they</em> entered their paradise!
Ah, that book was unusually lively reading,
for while holding the volume, while
improving my mind, the inhabitants—the
appreciative ones—had improved
their opportunity. They ascended my
sleeves for lunch—the book was intellectual
food for me, I was food for—I
will spare the reader’s feelings, the good
housewife is their enemy. Just as Satan
with appropriate taunts hurled his
mighty javelin at the archangel, so I
flung the sweet singer’s poem into the
corridor, thereby adding to its appearance
of usage. It was returned in triumph
to the library with a pair of tongs.
Some day, perhaps, an interested visitor
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>may see this volume, the librarian may
even indicate it with pride, and judging
by appearances (which are quite deceptive)
will remark how fond the poor
“cons” must be of good reading, of
classic literature, of standard works.
As for me, my fad is <em>new</em> books.</p>

<p class='c009'>Of the other fads, among the many,
is one which the man possesses who
makes exquisite paper boxes. His
paste was soap, till I taught him to
use oatmeal. Then there is the Greek
who grows onions. It is for company,
surely, for he cannot speak two words
of English, and has not a single visitor.
The library contains no Greek books,
and the English ones are Greek to
him. Once a week the great Empire
State presents a raw onion to each
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>condemned man. Death-Chamber and
raw onions—what a combination for
producing tears! Let me inform the
commonwealth that the onions are superfluous.
Some of us eat them. I
give mine away, but the Greek plants
all of his. This is vastly exciting.
First he makes little paper boxes that
just hold them, then packs them round
with tobacco, moistens the latter, and
then sits down and watches them grow.
This is almost literal, for never did
“green bay tree” so flourish. From
the rapid way they shoot up, I know
that if any blossoms or fruit grew on
the stalks they would be little balloons.
And the color! the most beautiful green
you ever saw—this from the tobacco. I
have always suspected that “State” tobacco
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>was made from some sort of—fertilizer!
So the Greek watches his
onions, and the death-watch watches the
Greek.</p>

<p class='c009'>I try to imagine his thoughts. It is
easily done. I am sure he sees the
little cottage and garden in the far-away
archipelago where he helped his
mother do just what he is doing now.
Perhaps that is the first thing he remembers—perhaps
it will be the last.
He is not handsome, but how his face
lights up sometimes! Then I know that
he is living over the days when, as a
youth, he worked in the vineyards or
among the currant bushes at home.
There is a romance behind it all, you
may be sure.</p>

<p class='c009'>Yesterday he was here watching his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>onions with all his usual care; to-day he
is gone, and the keepers are sweeping
his onions out and throwing them away,
for no one cares for the onions except
the Greek, and no one regrets the Greek,
except, perhaps, the onions.</p>

<p class='c009'>Happily this is not a sad ending, for
“John, the Greek,” has been given a
hope—he has gone to New York for a
new trial. His life was never in the
slightest danger, he having been tried
and sentenced by a judge who has condemned
many men to electrocution,
and not one of them, I believe, was ever
executed, because their trials before this
judge have been found by a higher
court to have been illegal. This is one
of “His Honor’s” little ways—he also
has his fad.</p>

  <h2 id='ch6' class='c011'><i>CHAPTER VI</i><br /> <br /><span class='under'><i><span class='small'>The Mayor of the Death-Chamber</span></i></span></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_0_7 c008'>I had ruled undisputed for a year—it
seemed a century. By common
consent I was the acknowledged
“Mayor of the Death-Chamber,”
and very properly so, for was not I the
oldest inhabitant? All questions were
referred to me. I was the final court
of arbitration; what I said “went.”</p>

<p class='c009'>This delightful state of affairs was undisturbed,
even undisputed, until Benjamin
appeared. Benjamin was a gentleman
of color, a youth with a penchant
for politics. Before he had been among
us long enough to learn to appreciate
“State” tobacco, he became rebellious.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>He disputed my authority. He was evidently
jealous. His ambition vaunted
itself till it seemed as if he would attempt
to appropriate to himself the perquisites
of my high office. Benjamin
was altogether impossible. He knew
all about politics; his brother worked
for an alderman. Benjamin insisted
upon expounding their intricacies and
the subterfuges necessary to carry wards
and districts. What a mayor could or
could not do was an open book to him.
Benjamin knew everything. He would
hear no reason, listen to no explanation,
had no respect for my year in the
Death-Chamber. He trampled upon
my rights; he was unceremonious, even
familiar. He questioned the legality of
my claims. He demanded a fair and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>open election, announcing himself to
our citizens as a candidate, the people’s
candidate, the poor man’s friend, a
Democrat! All that evening he gave
us of his oratory. He denounced me
in every scathing phrase to which he
could lay his tongue. I was an aristocrat,
a representative of trusts, a vile
Republican.</p>

<p class='c009'>A rival had presented himself. The
issues were joined. I bribed him into
silence with a cigar. The next evening
he demanded two to stop talking. I
refused. It was war to the death. I
made no speeches, but consulted with
my constituents. “We were seven,”
and seven fat cigars left my pocket; but
into the same receptacle from whence
they came I put the solid and unanimous
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>vote of the Death-Chamber. I
did more. I taught Benjamin a lesson.
I told him I did not care for that
office any more; that it was a burden I
would gladly lay down. He wept as he
thanked me. He worked hard, and received
pledges of support from every
voter—they had their instructions.</p>

<p class='c009'>It seemed a “walkover” for Benjamin.
He began to think how “Honorable”
would sound before his name.
The voting proceeded. The superintendent
of elections was the night
keeper. He announced Benjamin’s
unanimous election to the office of
Mayor. The sounds of revelry and
thanksgiving from Benjamin’s cage
sounded like rival camp-meetings possessed
of the devil. He—Ben, not the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>latter—made an eloquent speech of
thanks as befitting the occasion in
which, for the last time in his life, he
spoke well of me.</p>

<p class='c009'>In response he heard the announcement
of my election as—Governor.
Then there was silence in Benjamin’s
executive mansion, the “city hall,” as
he had just christened his cell. The first
official act of “His Excellency” was to
exercise his inherent right and remove
“His Honor, the Mayor,” from office.
Benjamin never recovered. When, a
few months later, they escorted Ben
through the “little door,” I think he
was perfectly willing to go.</p>

  <h2 id='ch7' class='c011'><i>CHAPTER VII</i><br /> <br /><span class='under'><i><span class='small'>A Psychological Experiment <br />(A Chronicle of the Tombs)</span></i></span></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_0_7 c008'>It was in the old Tombs prison and
in the old days which are past,
when they hung men in its courtyard,
and it was a very hot night in
summer. Of all the human beings within
its walls—keepers and kept—one man
alone was there because he wanted to
be. Not another beneath its old roof
but would gladly have changed his position—on
either side of the bars—for the
free hot night without. It was blistering,
and there was no breeze or beer
to be obtained in the Tombs, and very
little rest or sleep.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>Does it seem incongruous that a man
of wealth, culture, and position should
be there of his own volition? Not at
all; he was trying an experiment. And
that was why, after a liberal expenditure
of money and the use of some little
influence, this young man was the occupant
of that particular narrow cell
for the night. What he saw there was
very little, for the apartments were constructed
from a point of view not scenic
but secure. What he heard might perhaps
better be left unsaid. And what
he smelt was indescribable. For this
story is of the Tombs in the old days,
and really to describe it at night and
in summer would be to drive realism
insane. The home of misery, revelry,
and some repentance—tears and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>jests six inches apart—romance and
death, young sin and old crime; folly,
vice, and worse, all mixed together and
seasoned with a very little humor.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Tombs is like a sieve, separating
the unjust within from—well, the more
or less just without. It is like some
great iron net through which the tide of
criminal life surges, and many are the
strange fish caught therein. If fish,
one of my senses assures me that many
of them have been out of their natural
element for a long while. Some of
them were not caught yesterday or even
the day before. They are old, and you
know it even as you approach.</p>

<p class='c009'>But it is with this young man’s feelings
we have to do. In spite of the
investigator’s unpleasant surroundings,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>his thoughts were those of happy anticipation,
and his mood that of extreme
satisfaction. All unmindful of the misery
on every side, he paced up and
down the little cell, in which the faint
light from the corridor chased shadows
on the stone floor and dim walls.
His face bore a look of triumph. He
congratulated himself. What to him
were the disturbances that assaulted his
senses, the noises of those who amused
themselves according to their possibilities,
or the snoring of some who dully
slept, luxuriating in the comforts of the
best home they had ever known, the
vomiting of a drunken sailor across the
tier, an obscene song from a young
negro with a falsetto voice heard along
the corridor, or the clog dancing of an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>“artist” directly over his head, who
whistled his own accompaniment. These
things were nothing. He scarcely heard
the shriek of the delirium tremens case in
the hospital ward below, nor the curses
of the person constrained in the straight-jacket.
The remarks of the poor devil
occupying the “cooler” were naught.
The smell of iodoform was lost to him,
for all this had nothing to do with his
experiment.</p>

<p class='c009'>Had you seen the books on theosophy,
occult science, reports of psychological
societies, etc., in his beautiful
apartments uptown, you would perhaps
have guessed his object. But only he
could have told you properly of his enthusiastic
devotion, his absorbing interest
in these studies, and, most of all,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>of his disappointing attempts at personal
research. For in spite of closest
study, deepest investigations, and widest
experimenting, his longing and anxiety
to see an apparition had never been
satisfied. Such things as ghosts existed,
he was sure of that—he knew it.
Others had seen them. But his ardent
longing to have personal demonstration
of their presence remained unsatisfied,
despite the many séances attended,
desperate colds contracted in churchyards,
and heroic pilgrimages to alleged
mahatmas. Oh, the bitterness of hearing
and rehearing the success of others
whose accounts he even found himself
jealous enough to doubt!</p>

<p class='c009'>But at last it had come—this inspiration.
Did the doctrine of environment
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>mean anything at all? Assuredly!
Here was the key to the situation, and
that is why arrangements had been effected
by him to sleep alone in the cell,
the very bed, and bedclothes of a man
hanged that afternoon. That is why he
awaited midnight in the Tombs—midnight
in “Murderers’ Row.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He had been careful to attend the
execution and to view the remains so as
to recognize the astral body when it
should appear later, for was it not absolutely
certain that the spirit, consciousness—call
it what you will—of
the departed man would return searching
for its body? And where to if not
this little space the earthly part had occupied
so long and where every emotion
had been known? Surely this cell
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>would be the first place to attract the
released spirit. Here for the deceased
had been the dreamings of past days, the
horror of the realized present, the torture
of the anticipated future. Long
days and longer nights in which the inmate
had burned with the fever of
hope or shivered with the chill of despair.
In this room his mind had been
the home of every emotion. What
hate, revenge, fear had these walls seen
glower from his eyes! What prayers
had been heard in weaker moments,
confessions perhaps solitude had wrung
from his lips! Here had been all passions.
Here he had heard the cold
voice of the sheriff reading the death
warrant. Success was assured. There
could be no doubt about it; and it had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>remained for this adventurer to discover
the untrodden path. He was there to
note and describe everything. Sublime
discovery, method extraordinary, most
perfect system of wresting the unknowable
from the superhuman! He felt a
veritable Columbus of daring. And the
envy of his fellow-investigators in turn
when he should give his contribution
to science and should read his paper!
Why, this very experience would be
quoted in books! It nerved him to attempt
anything.</p>

<p class='c009'>He took out a note-book and began
to prepare the opening of his prospective
address. The night keeper on the last
round accepted his cigars and said good
night. It grew quieter. The singers
were hoarse, the hospital patient quiet
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>or drugged into quietness, and the inhabitant
of the “cooler” had expressed
all his opinions of every one and subsided.
The time had come to prepare
for the reception of the released spirit.
It was his own body the experimenter
proposed to submit as the material part
to which the murderer’s consciousness
might find access. He must undress.
He did so, and contemplated the soiled
sheets; but it was in the interests of
science, and he did not hesitate. And
now to compose his mind, to cultivate
an abstracted calm, to wait and observe.
Such was the success of this attempt
that he slept.</p>

<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c009'>Twelve solemn strokes.... He
awoke. A dim light filtered in from the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>corridors. There were low murmurings
in the air. The stairway creaked.
A chain rattled. And somewhere far
off a gate closed with a clang. The
proverbial cold perspiration streamed
from him. The orthodox goose-flesh
appeared. His hair rose as it ought to.
His flesh literally crept. Everything
was as it should be. All the proper
symptoms in their proper order. Something
was in the room with him.</p>

<p class='c009'>Was it the murderer’s spirit returning?
The black cap over his gleaming,
protruding eyes, groping in the darkness
back to his last place of rest, feeling
his way, searching the bed, and
touching the intruder of his domicile?
Yes, he feels something resembling the
murderer’s clammy, trembling fingers
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>passing over him. Victory? Success?
Eureka? This awful moment should
be the happiest of his life.</p>

<p class='c009'>But a great horror came upon him.
With a shriek which awoke the warden
and deputy warden, the principal keeper,
the deputy principal keeper, the guards,
turnkeys, watchman, nurses, messengers,
and all the prisoners, every living soul
within the walls, he threw back the bedclothes
and looked with agonizing eyes
at—a score of bloated little red demons
running away into the shadows as fast
as their innumerable legs could carry
them.</p>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_0_7 c008'>“That’s me and Mike,” he exclaimed,
reverently removing
the newspaper covering and
thrusting an old tintype into my hands.
And then I recognized “Mike,” for he
came to see my neighbor every day—in
his mother’s arms. We (Mike’s father
and I) were neighbors, and neighborly—which
are two different things—and
often walked together during exercise
hours, I listening and he telling of the
doings of the little “geezer” and the
“tricks me and Mike have turned off
together.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Yes, I knew Mike, and he grew to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>look for the candy I sent him by Apple
Mary, but he never thanked us; and,
considering his short two years of life,
Mary and I did not expect it. His
mother spoke to Mike’s father—on the
other side of the bars, no doubt about
it. I have heard her! Papa talked
back, but Mike only smiled and cooed.
Among other things, my neighbor told
me that the police “had him right,” and
so it seemed, and the day of sentence
came round. “Me and Mike” and
Mike’s mother exchanged kisses and
epithets; then the sheriff began his
search. He found the tintype and gave
it to Mike’s mother despite angry protests;
and then my neighbor made a
very foolish move. It was towards his
hip pocket; he put up a good fight
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>while it lasted. But he was overpowered
and handcuffed and the concealed
weapon drawn forth—it was Mike’s
little blue shoe. Somehow or other I
did not see the rest of it very distinctly.</p>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_0_7 c008'>Do funny things happen in the
Tombs? Lord bless you, yes!
Why, you have only to visit
it to meet the prince of humorists.
Come! He will be at the door to meet
you; in fact he is “laying” for you, and
will show you through the entire institution
and out again—which is not a
detail. He is affable to a degree, and
you would be vastly amused if, like us,
you were on the “inside.” But you
will probably listen seriously; and although
you will not lose a word of his
remarks, you will lose all their exquisite
humor. It is Old John who has the fun
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>all to himself, for he is a wag in his
way, and combines business with pleasure.
He is a true story-teller. How
I envy him his imagination! What
tales I would tell if it were mine! I
could—yes, I would write several novels
and do five-act plays, dozens of them.
Old John could easily be a poet or a
writer. He certainly is an actor. No
tragedian who I have ever heard can
put such horror into his voice. His
sepulchral tones, with just the proper
amount of tremolo in them, would make
the fortune of any Thespian. Of course
it is impossible for type to reproduce it.</p>

<p class='c009'>Old John shows you through the
main building, the Women’s Prison and
Boys’ Prison, together with the New
Prison, the Ten-Day House, the Hospital,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>Kitchen, <i>et al.</i> He romances with
the ardor of a born raconteur; he knows
you will pay him something, but were
that not so, I believe he would do it for
the love of his art.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Do you see that man? He’s in for
m-u-r-d-e-r!” You shudder and turn
away, saying “poor fellow” perhaps,
and the sweet girl you are escorting
gets a little closer to your strong right
arm; and immediately you are vastly
interested in this subject, and determined
to thoroughly discuss, to exhaust
the topic. And yet the unfortunate
man may have committed no more
heinous crime than the theft of a door
mat, or that equally felonious one of
peddling clams without a license. Yet I
am sure you would readily condone this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>departure from the exact truth, even
were you aware of it. Old John selects
the crime to fit the physiognomy of his
subject and enjoys your curiosity immensely,
but he never smiles. A neat
little gloved hand may have slipped into
yours, or more likely you have appropriated
it—I have known it to be done—and
to prolong the moment you ask,
“Where is Molineux?” The question
is not altogether an unfamiliar one; it
has been asked so often that Old John
has given it very considerable thought;
and in his answer he rises to a high
dramatic effect. “I dasn’t show you!”
he quavers. “I dasn’t even go near
where he is my own self”—each tone
is a triumph of horror, the descending
cadence drives the blood back into your
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>heart, and that pretty girl—bless her!—imagines
a Molineux eight feet tall,
who eats raw meat, and can neither read
nor write. He winks at me if I am
standing by and overhear. How does
he keep from laughing?</p>

<p class='c009'>Oh, the fund of information he
will impart to you as he guides you
around! “Yes, the men is allowed to
walk up and down in their cells or to
sit on the bed daily.” All this on one
tone and in one breath. What an engineer
John is! Listen to his description
of the mighty wall which encloses the
Tombs: “That high wall around the
prison was built at great expense of
money, time, and men, so as to put the
yard inside of it.” And an architect!
“This building and that building isn’t
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>the same building at all.” Ah, there is
method in it all! He is leading, as every
great dramatist does, up to his climax.
Old John approaches it with reverential
awe: this great beam of wood, lying
in the yard, what stories it could tell!
But John anticipates any superfluous remarks
this obsolete institution might
make for itself.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Do you see that beam of wood?
That’s the last piece of the old gallows;
all the rest has been cut up for relics;
here the rope was tied.” Old John’s
monologue, which follows, closes with
these words: “And here you see the
marks made by the axe in the hands of
the hangman when it cut the rope that
sprung the trap, launching the unhappy
wretch into eternity. They do not hang
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>yet any more, they make them sit in a
chair up at Sing Sing, and kills them
with nobody knows what.” He never
says electrocution, it’s too much for him;
perhaps he does not believe in it—neither
do I.</p>

<p class='c009'>We suspect that every now and then
John freshens up these marks himself;
should this part of the old apparatus be
painted, John would lose half his income—those
chips, not his face, are his fortune.
How little a quarter must seem,
how good is life to a visitor after hearing
John and seeing the old gallows!
Old John is a judge of human nature: if
he thinks you will stand it, he points
to a black stone in the side of the old
Tombs and tells you it is where a colored
man dashed his brains out long
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>ago rather than be hung, and how the
successive wardens have tried unsuccessfully
to remove the stain.</p>

<p class='c009'>I remove my hat to his genius when
I recall an instance of John’s impromptus.
One afternoon a well-known
clergyman called and joined me in my
walk over the cobblestones in the prison
yard. We talked long and earnestly—the
dominie and I—and smoked large
black cigars. Old John arrived with a
party of eager visitors. Old John was
in a state of prime satisfaction; business
was good and his pilgrims were appreciative.
After pointing me out, he was
asked if the minister was Molineux’s
spiritual adviser. Oh, John, what inspired
you to sin, and have you ever
confessed it? Was it the dominie’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>cigar? “Do you see that reverend
gentleman? He was arrested this morning
for throwing his mother-in-law out
of the third-story window; he will get
twenty years at least.” The horror-stricken
visitors looked at the calm, intellectual
face at my side and gasped.
Not one of them had curiosity about
me after that. I was a poor worm in
comparison with my more awful companion.
I wonder what they will say
should they enter Dr. ----’s beautiful
church some Sunday and see him in the
pulpit.</p>

<p class='c009'>John never “smiles.” Wait a minute!
Hold on about that! About
once a month he is missed over night;
they say he does “smile” periodically,
and then very frequently indeed; the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>next morning every one in the Tombs
accuses him of gallantry. No wonder;
John has a very handsome goatee, and
knows it. We accuse him of gallantry.
How immensely pleased he is, and how
modestly he protests! “Methinks he
doth protest too much.” I asked him
once about the matter. “Is it true,
John, these things I hear about you?”
This was his reply: “Some says I do
and some says I don’t.” You will never
get Old John to compromise himself.
I suspect he has, like many of us, taken
the “third degree” at some time during
his long life. I said to him, “John,
you have been here a long time, and
must have acquired quite a lot of money;
why don’t you go home and settle
down?” Could Solomon excel the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>reply? “Because they would take away
the little I have and send me back for
more.” I shall not be more definite
about my friend’s age, for two reasons.
The first is that he would not like it;
the second, that I do not know it—no
one does, no one remembers when he
first came. There is much speculation
in the Tombs as to Old John’s financial
status; on this question he keeps his
own counsel; he can always change a
$50 bill; perhaps he is your landlord.</p>

<p class='c009'>There is another matter upon which
he imparts information to visitors—the
most important one—it comes like the
catastrophe of a play, just before the
curtain is rung down. “Do you see
that man all dressed up in brass buttons?”
(pointing to a keeper). “He’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>a keeper, <em>he</em> gets paid a salary for <em>his</em>
services. But I only gets what the kind
<em>visitors</em> gives me, and all I gets over a
dollar I buys tobacco with for the poor
unfortunate men you see dressed up
in stripes, who have no money!”
Whew! Old John (the rascal) will
give the tobacco in the next world—<em>perhaps</em>!
and a light with it—maybe.</p>

<p class='c009'>Out of consideration for many years’
sojourn with Old John, I will not state
his salary. But if I ever get out of here
(which <em>I</em> never will), and Old John
should die (which <em>he</em> never will), I shall
apply for his position. Come and see the
old Tombs for yourself, where so many
good fellows have lived and died, before
it is too late. Come and listen to
Old John, and pay him well, for it’s
worth the money.</p>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_0_7 c008'>Bridget, alias “The Rummager”
(rummager means
thief, pickpocket), was incorrigible;
had always been so, and there
were many reasons for it, such as heredity,
environment, opportunity, habit.
Bridget had been in the “Pen” (Penitentiary),
the work-house, the Tombs.
“Had been,” for “The Rummager”
was free. She was just leaving the latter
prison on the afternoon of Monday,
February 24, 1902. There was
money in her pocket. She had worked
in the laundry doing washing for the
aristocrats and millionaires over in the
men’s prison.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>Freedom and money! This had always
before meant a celebration, but to-day
Bridget kept on her way towards
Chinatown, passing for the first time the
side doors of the saloons which had been
best loved and most patronized. She did
what she had never done before under
such circumstances—she hurried home.
Bridget was welcomed, was invited to
make an occasion of the event. She declined.
This behavior caused consternation
and criticism in “The Barracks.”
Bridget hurried away to the “Bend.”
There she haggled with Isaac over the
price of a dress—a black dress. Finally
it was hers, but it took her last penny—and
all her other bills and coins.</p>

<p class='c009'>Bridget disappeared. This was no
novelty, such occurrences were not unusual.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>No one worried about it. Some
hours afterward they learned that she
was working. They jeered at and reviled
the joker who brought the news.
That afternoon, for the first time in her
life, Bridget earned an honest dollar.
It was perhaps the first money not spent
in dissipation.</p>

<p class='c009'>The next morning was the first time
she had ever bought flowers. “The
Rummager” laid them upon the coffin
of her friend—“The Tombs Angel.”</p>

<p class='c014'>[<span class='sc'>Note.</span>—Mrs. Salome C. Foster, of blessed memory,
for many years devoted herself to the unfortunates confined
in the city prisons. This valuable and beautiful

<p class='drop-capa0_0_0_7 c008'>All that is enjoyable; all that one
would possess, and do if one
could, is summed up in this
word—Life!</p>

<p class='c009'>What is it that the young would see?
and the flight of which is regretted by
the old? It is Life!</p>

<p class='c009'>This is the almost universal meaning
of the word. You speak it, and think
of dance and song, women and wine,
sunlight, blue skies, and freedom.</p>

<p class='c009'>To us it has another meaning—try
and imagine it.</p>

<p class='c009'>Sometimes when an important trial
is closing and the jury is out till midnight
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>perhaps, we, the inhabitants of
the Tombs, sit up and listen for the
little bell which rings in the prison, because
one of us is being brought back
across the “Bridge of Sighs.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Here he comes! “What did you
get?” calls out a friend from the top
tier, and there is a clutch at every heart,
a horror that you on the outside will
never be able to appreciate, when we
hear the answer, the sentence most
dreaded—“<span class='sc'>Life</span>.”</p>

  <h2 id='ch12' class='c011'><i>CHAPTER XII</i><br /> <br /><span class='under'><i><span class='small'>My Friend the Major</span></i></span></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_0_7 c008'>Without exception, the Major
is one of the finest men
I have ever met. I like
him so much that I am willing to tell
a truthful story, or rather, tell a story
truthfully (which is a very different
thing), at my own expense.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was this way: Benjamin had got
religion. Benjamin preached a long
sermon to us every single evening; he
preached revival sermons, missionary
sermons, and obituary ones on all the
fellows who had gone through the “little
door.” When he had exhausted these—and
us, he would say, “Now this is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>what I am going to say about <em>you</em>, Mr.
Roland, after you have gone.” What
followed would depend on how I had
treated him during the day.</p>

<p class='c009'>Another reason why Ben preached.
Benjamin had made me this very handsome
proposition: He knew a man in
Brooklyn who owned a tent. <em>I</em> was to
hire that tent, and sing outside to attract
a crowd. We agreed that I could do that
successfully. Then <em>I</em> should enter and
sing inside, and <em>he</em> would stand at the
door and collect ten cents from all who
entered (if there were any so foolish).
Then <em>he</em> would preach, after which <em>I</em>
should sing again while <span class='fss'>HE</span> took up a
collection. I tried to suggest other
orders of events, but Ben insisted that
this was the <em>only</em> one he could agree to;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>and as it seemed perfectly fair, I consented.
If Ben had only lived, how rich
and famous we should have become, and
happy, too, for Ben enchanted me with
descriptions of all the nice colored girls
we should meet. Life was <em>very</em> tempting.
On account of this arrangement
with me Ben thought it necessary to
rehearse his sermons every night, so
as to get into practice. He addressed
them to “youse poor, mean, miserable,
damned sinners in here in the Death-Chamber.”
His elocution consisted of
main strength.</p>

<p class='c009'>We were tired of it, so Larry swore
out a warrant; Shorty indicted him;
Eddy committed him to prison; and
finally he was brought to trial. John
was the jury. I defended my colored
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>brother, and the Major, who was on
duty that evening, prosecuted him.
Why did I defend him? Because he
sent me three oranges and implored my
help. I asked him if these were all he
had (this is a lawyer’s first duty toward
himself). They were, so I accepted his
retainer, and told him not to worry
about his affairs—neither did I.</p>

<p class='c009'>The case came up that evening, and
I asked for a postponement, for I have
observed that all expensive attorneys
do this. No adjournment was allowed,
however, so I explained to my client
that the District Attorney’s office was
trying to “railroad him,” and he must
raise more funds. He tendered a paper
of State tobacco and three toothpicks.
I took the tobacco, but refused
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>to consider the toothpicks as collateral—I
had seen newer ones. I demanded
more tobacco; he had to borrow another
package. Then, knowing I had
everything he possessed, I was ready to
proceed.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Judge Sparta,” of Binghamton, presided,
and a more learned and impartial
jurist never wore “sneaks” (felt-soled
slippers). The trial proceeded under
his just rulings, and with great decorum.
The evidence was so conflicting, that it
was agreed between counsel that whoever
made the best speech in summing
up should win the case. I felt sorry, indeed,
for my opponent, for the Major is
a silent man. I summed up with all my
usual eloquence. Even the judge was
affected as I pleaded and threatened. I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>was humorous and scornful by turns, the
jury wept or laughed at my pleasure,
and when I spoke of Benjamin, I made
a bishop of him, dressed him in episcopal
robes, and placed him at the head of
a great university (the tent). I showed
how his white hair would be loved and
venerated at this seat of learning—<em>if</em> he
lived. There was not a dry eye in the
Death-Chamber when I finished this
part of my oration. And when I closed
with a scathing arraignment of the Major’s
legal methods, the great crowd in
the auditorium, who had remained spellbound,
prisoners to my eloquence, burst
into frantic cheers. During all the time
I had been speaking not a single man
had left the room. “That speech should
be put in the fourth reader,” said the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>judge. I had a right to think that mine
indeed had been a powerful effort—I
had made a home run. I was number
one. I knew I had the Major licked.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Major’s speech! Words fail me
to describe how, from lofty to still more
lofty flights his oratory ascended, climax
upon climax and further climaxes still!
Even I was thrilled. I forgot my case,
my client—everything. I may say it was
a long speech—yes, I think I am justified
in saying so. First came Henry Ward
Beecher’s great abolition sermon, then
Ingersoll’s oration at the grave of his
brother, next Lincoln’s immortal speech
at Gettysburg. Heavens! what a memory
that man had. The very bars of
our cages melted like wax as he proceeded
to declaim his own speech of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>thanks on the occasion when the Tarrytown
Fire Department presented him
with a speaking trumpet. Here the enthusiasm
of my constituents could be
restrained no longer. They cheered
the Major. They reviled <em>me</em>! I was
told to get under the bed. Then followed
the Masonic burial service, about
our weary feet having come to the end
of the toilsome journey before the
Great White Throne. When the Major
reached this point Benjamin could
see, in his mind’s eye, the cemetery, the
open grave amid the tombs and monuments;
he could see the pall, the coffin
under it, and—himself inside the coffin.
Blue perspiration exuded from Benjamin’s
person. I could plainly hear his
teeth chatter as these awful phrases
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>rolled from the Major’s lips as only he
can roll them. They made Benjamin
sick—I didn’t feel very well myself.</p>

<p class='c009'>Of course the jury, who was another
Mason, convicted Benjamin of the crime
of—heresy in the <em>last</em> degree. But Ben
maintained to the very day of his death
that the Major “conjahed me with
churchyard dirt,” and I believe the
Major always has a rabbit’s foot concealed
about him; at least I hope so,
if it brings him good luck.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_0_7 c008'>That the present condition of
affairs regarding the administration
of justice in New
York City is unsatisfactory, will hardly
be denied, while such glaring instances
of recent incompetency are fresh in the
public mind. The many comments and
editorials appearing in the best metropolitan
newspapers attest that our citizens
are conscious of the defects in this
department, while the press of other
cities throughout the country, and even
abroad, reminds us in no uncertain tones
how we are regarded by our neighbors.
This matter has been recognized of recent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>years, and attention called to it
by investigating committees appointed
by our Legislature. But the efforts of
these committees have been too widely
distributed; they have attempted to investigate
too many things in general;
and the methods of the District Attorney’s
office in particular, although regarded
with suspicion by a large majority
of those who read and think, and
with contempt by those who know, remain—unexposed,
despite the fact that
they demand immediate attention.</p>

<p class='c009'>It would seem as if some of the
strenuous periodicals with which we are
blessed, or otherwise, would find here
a fruitful field for sensational effort; but
it is precisely to “yellow journalism”
that the District Attorney’s office caters;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>and this branch of the press will be unlikely
to turn and bite the hand which
feeds it so generously. The better type
of journalism will have none of these
matters. Those of the legal profession
who know—the lawyers practising in
criminal law courts—must be careful
not to offend so powerful an institution,
whose disfavor might mean ruin. And
the Bar Association ignores or postpones
action. No persons in private life care
to take the initiative; and perhaps they
are right. It is safest not to interfere.
Why then should I undertake the task?
Simply because I have suffered unjustly,
and have seen others suffer injustice.
This is my sole warrant and authority.
And in this matter I am very much in
earnest.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>The present state of affairs is the result
of previous conditions, older methods
of criminal procedure, which have
been developed and expanded until at
the present time they have overstepped
all decency.</p>

<p class='c009'>Let us begin at the beginning, for
what I am about to describe may happen
to any one. When a man is arrested
the police proceed as follows: Invariably
starting with protestations of sympathy
and faith in their prisoner’s innocence,
they make offers of help and assistance.
The suspect is coaxed into a confession
if possible; this is the first degree. Let
us further suppose that, on his part, all
guilt or knowledge is denied. Then the
second degree is “worked.” Here
traps will be laid for him—he will be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>lied to, threatened, frightened, it may be.
A lawyer may now appear. He says an
agonized mother has retained him to
take the case; he guarantees immediate
release, and is ready to hear the story.
But suppose the “agonized mother” to
have been dead many years, naturally
his services are declined. It is well.
The confidence would have been extended
to a policeman. I have heard
that a cassock sometimes robes the
same individual on a similar errand.
This “moral suasion” may be extended
over even a day or two, reinforced by
such pleasantries as being awakened the
moment one drops asleep. Meals are
“forgotten,” a drink of water is an impossibility;
or liquor is plied if that will
open lips. In summer a cheerful fire
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>may burn very near the cell door; the
windows are closed, one may perspire a
trifle. If the season be winter, no inconvenience
is felt by reason of superfluous
heat. This is not denied by police
officials. I believe Superintendent
Byrnes describes all these methods in
his book, and tells how a suspect is
locked up in a cell with the instruments
of the crime he is accused of having
committed, or even with the “corpus
delicti” itself. Proof of this method is
found in that atrociously and hideously
managed persecution of a young woman,
in which evidence collected in this manner
was offered in court—and very properly
ruled out by the presiding judge.
The case is too recent to be forgotten.</p>

<p class='c009'>If the prisoner still remains obstinate,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>the third degree follows in due course.
This is not at all the bloody affair which
some fancies have painted it. The appearance
of those who have just gone
through the ordeal indicates nothing unusual—perhaps
a little pallor and a slight
derangement of the digestive organs;
for to be struck in the stomach with
a lusty fist enclosed within a boxing
glove or beaten across the kidneys with
a piece of rubber garden hose leaves
no marks, that is, on the <em>outside</em>. No
right-minded person who has experienced
this will ever complain to the
courts; he has no witnesses; “there is
more in the closet.” I believe that the
“third degree” is very seldom used
unless there is almost a moral certainty
that the person subjected to it is the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>proper one to receive this modern torture.</p>

<p class='c009'>I have never experienced the “third
degree.” To me, as to every other
good citizen, the term had been a familiar
one; but the details never having
been made public, my impressions of
this ceremony were extremely vague,
until a time came when opportunities
were frequent to get information regarding
this matter at second-hand, decidedly
the best way of obtaining it.
During the exercise hours in the
Tombs prison, I walked with scores
of men who have gone through this
initiation. For two years I asked questions
of those who could not possibly
be in collusion to deceive me; and as all
their stories agreed, I think I have given
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>a correct description of the three degrees.
My little diary, kept all that
time, contains my notes and lies before
me. There was another place in which
I heard about the third degree. On
rainy days in the Death-Chamber at
Sing Sing prison, when it was too dark
to read (and there were many “gloomy”
days during those two years), we whispered
our experiences to one another.
All my companions had been taken to
Police Headquarters or to station
houses when arrested. I went to the
Tombs directly from the Coroner’s
Court; across the “Bridge of Sighs,”
or, as we call it, “The Suspension of
Howls,” and there is no “third degree”
practised in the Tombs.</p>

<p class='c009'>The “third degree” is not a fixed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>ceremony. It is regulated to suit the individual
(I do not mean his taste), and
differs with the personality of the grand
master. Its object is simply to promote
conversation in the hope that
something compromising will be said.
It is almost always a success; some persons
become even garrulous. No excuse
or explanation is ever made for the
third degree, because its use is vigorously
denied by those in authority. But
I do make such an excuse; there is much
to be said in its favor. Guilt cannot be
hunted down by innocence. You must
“match cunning with guile,” “you must
fight the devil with fire,” and when
clubs are trumps—play them.</p>

<p class='c009'>Take this matter home to yourself;
imagine a case in which you are very
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>much interested. Your house has been
entered and all your wife’s jewelry
stolen; you complain to the police. Of
course, having done so, the yellow journals
print a full account of the robbery,
also more or less flattering fake portraits
of yourself and family. Your
bath-room, through which the burglar
entered, is described in detail; your
billiard table, library cuspidor, etc.,
are photographed and printed life-size
in the evening editions. The next day
a portrait of the pretty typewriter
employed at your office is displayed,
whom some lynx-eyed reporter has
discovered wearing diamonds. Then
everything you <em>never</em> did in your life
is disclosed. The “journalists” take
possession of your home; an old pair
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>of slippers and a bicycle hat of bygone
days are discovered. You stole the
jewelry yourself, you know you did!
Your hidden sins stand revealed in
all their repulsiveness. The finger of
sensational journalism has torn the
mask of hypocrisy, so long and successfully
worn, from your repellant
countenance at last. Confess, miserable
wretch! Pictures of Judas Iscariot,
Captain Kidd, and others of their type
appear in the hysterical press. They
are all labelled with <em>your</em> name. How
you will be roasted! “It is said,” etc.,
that on dark nights you steal forth to
exhume deceased infants from their
tombs—and to eat them. Are you ill-advised
enough to deny this? Beware!
As for the partner of your joys and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>sorrows, “We have it on undeniable
authority,” etc., etc., that she went
yachting with that gay club fellow
Noah, and has been engaged to each
one of his guests in turn. For a
penny, “all who run may read” these
romances; the only redeeming feature
being that those who read do not believe.
While this is going on your
better half stays in her room and weeps.</p>

<p class='c009'>The servants leave, and you have to
answer the door-bell yourself and be
polite(?) to the representatives of the
press, who call every few moments for
interviews, and who never print a word
you say to them. Every tradesman you
deal with sends a collector with his bill;
your life insurance policies are cancelled.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>Then the police captain of the precinct
sends for you. You go prepared
to be cast into prison. Not so; while
the “Journal,” “World,” and “Herald”
have been clearing up the mystery
of this “inside job,” the police
have made an arrest. The prisoner is
a well-known burglar. On that night
and at the time your house was entered
he was seen loitering outside, but just
at present he won’t talk. You know
that he either robbed you himself, or
watched while a confederate did. Do
you want your wife’s property? Do
you want your character back again?
Do you want to get “hunk”? Remember,
whoever entered your house
came prepared to kill. Perhaps you
are a father, and know your conscientious
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>duty towards that eldest son of
yours, your own flesh and blood, when
he has misbehaved and is sulky. Do
you birch him? Do you trounce him,
or do you stop to argue? Is it more
brutal to inflict corporal punishment
upon a man than upon a child?</p>

<p class='c009'>But you don’t stop now to debate
that question. You fling yourself upon
your knees, and with tears implore that
you be allowed to assist at—“the third
degree.” You even offer all the worldly
goods you have left for the privilege of
plying that garden hose yourself—just
once, where it will do the most good.
Stop, sir, the law forbids! After a
couple of howls the peevishness of your
new acquaintance vanishes. He speaks.
In a few hours your property is restored,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>and you are distributing cigars
and buying wine for the reporters, in
the hope that they will stop lying about
you. Your wife condescends to speak
to you for the first time in days. If
upon his trial the rogue should plead
that an illegal confession had been
wrung from him, and the police should
deny it, would you go to court and
corroborate the thief, or would you “lie
like a gentleman”?</p>

<p class='c009'>The question is, Is the “third degree”
ever used to compel a confession from
an innocent person, or to satisfy a
grudge? In either case the abuse, not
the use, is to be condemned. Are theories
made up without evidence, and
some poor victim made to fit the case by
means of torture? Was “Frenchy”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>really innocent and in prison all those
years? If not, why was he pardoned
a few months ago? Was McAuliffe
beaten to death to satisfy a grudge, or
for fear of future revelations? It is
not my business to find out. I have
been informed that at the last election
the people selected some one else to do
that; and if in theorizing upon these
subjects to myself I have come to no
conclusion which I care to give here, I
am sure I do the “Finest” no injustice,
for they have theorized on my case for
nearly four years, and have come to no
conclusion at all.</p>

<p class='c009'>The first and second degrees are efforts
to outwit a criminal. They would
seldom entrap an innocent person.
Moreover, the accused need not answer
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>questions, and this should be the course
pursued by any one accused of crime,
no matter how innocent. The first and
second degrees are admitted to exist;
the third degree has been described,
and, on the whole, I am inclined to approve
of it, although unlawful. It has
brought many criminals to justice; but
I do not defend the <em>fourth degree</em>, which
is the name I use, for the lack of a better
one, to describe the present state of
affairs existing in the office of the public
prosecutor. It is a continuation of
the others, after the affair reaches the
hands of an Assistant District Attorney
with an ambition for a record for securing
convictions—one looking for a
reputation. It is made possible by twin
evils of recent birth: yellow journalism
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>and expert testimony. Summed up, it
is the use of slander and perjury. In the
“fourth degree” the pen is mightier
than the night stick—the victim is not
pounded with the “locust,” but in the
press. Like the fourth dimension of
space, if there is one, this state of affairs
is invisible; but invisible only because
we will not observe.</p>

<p class='c009'>Permit me to prove the existence of
this fourth degree. Time was, when
trials in the criminal courts of this county
were intended to determine the guilt
or the innocence of the accused. All this
is changed now; convictions must be obtained
by every and any means, when
money and reputations are to be made;
and the secret methods of convicting innocent
men constitute the fourth degree.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>Immediately upon arrest, or even before,
public opinion is aroused against the
suspect by inflammatory newspaper
statements in which the victim is accused
of crime; the presumption of innocence
is no longer allowed him. His
family is branded by the most contemptible
calumnies; and the public is assured
in every edition that the authorities have
ample proof of the accused’s guilt, that
new evidence is constantly pouring in,
and that conviction is a certainty. During
this trial in the newspapers, fake
evidence is published; opinions of previous
officials not noted for their over-blameless
public lives are printed, experts
are turned loose—all of them, of
course, on one side—and this is kept up
until it is believed that public opinion has
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>been swayed against the victim. Eulogies
on the generosity and fairness of the
assistant prosecutor in charge are
printed editorially (making certain the
source from whence these articles emanate,
for in our day, the District Attorney’s
office has become a news agency
for sensational journalism). In the manner
affected by all savages, this red fire is
burnt, tum-tums are beaten, stink-balls
thrown to distract public attention from
what is about to happen.</p>

<p class='c009'>Now comes an all important part of
the fourth degree. The public prosecutor
declares that he has never known
a plainer case of guilt; and deprives
the accused of the examination before a
magistrate, which the law guarantees
him, by “railroading” the case before
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>the Grand Jury, which has been prepared
and prejudiced by poisoning the
wells of information—the press. These
proceedings being secret, evidence favorable
to the defendant is suppressed;
and lies can be manufactured if needed,
for no cross-examination of witnesses is
permitted. It is the golden opportunity
of any secret foe. Of course an indictment
can always be secured under such
circumstances, the accused branded and
thrown into prison, and need never know
one word of the evidence against him.
Great is the political and legal capital
of the Assistant District Attorney who
manages a case in this way, especially if
the victim be a big fish. He is called
a “Fearless Prosecutor”—an “Able
Assistant.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>If the accused has money he can
appeal to a higher court and have such
an illegal indictment set aside, but the
prosecuting attorney will make this
process long and expensive. The more
money the accused spends now, the less
he will have for the necessities of the
trial, and his wily opponent knows this
well. The Able Assistant is not troubled
with matters financial. There are fresh
bond issues for him, if necessary.
Should the Grand Jury refuse to indict
and discharge the accused, the “Fearless
One” simply arrests him again, and
repeats his efforts before another Grand
Jury; all the time assuring the public
that the prisoner’s millions will not save
him, and that the prosecutor can be
trusted to drag him to the bar of justice.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>He does it, too, sooner or later.
That is, it is called the “bar of justice.”
During this time the people’s counsel
makes his grand stand play. He challenges
the accused under enormous
headlines—“Are you innocent of the
crime?” Then produce the culprit,
prove his guilt; and this learned and
generous gentleman of legal attainments
will release you.</p>

<p class='c009'>Finally, the accused is cast into
prison, and kept there. He must rely
on his friends and his lawyers. This is
all very well presuming he has them,
but hard indeed for the poor fellow who
has none. In other words, a man is put
in a position where he cannot defend
himself. Perhaps the offence is a bailable
one, let bail be offered; it is immediately
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>increased. The unfortunate
victim cannot get out on bail. The Able
Assistant will see to that. In the meantime,
any persons who it seems probable
are to be witnesses for the defence
are subpœnaed and terrorized, if possible,
threatened with arrest, insulted,
bullied. The yellow newspapers, hungry
for sensation, have put the defendant
at the mercy of every blackmailer and
crank. Their offers of reward invite all
men without principle, but with a price,
to make fake identifications which will
implicate him. Does the prosecution
desire any particular person for a witness?
Such persons are simply kidnapped
and put in the House of Detention.</p>

<p class='c009'>Time elapses, perhaps years; all is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>now ready for the trial in court. No!
I have forgotten to mention that the
county of New York will give a lawyer
five hundred dollars to defend a penniless
man accused of murder. This is
American, this is fair play, it is a helping
hand to the under dog. Under, because
the fearless prosecutor can spend,
and has often spent, hundreds of thousands
of dollars to obtain a conviction.
His limit is the sky, for it costs his
pocket nothing, and when the prosecution
makes the issue on expert testimony,
the odds on conviction will be
two hundred and fifty thousand dollars,
which the State may perhaps spend, to
this five hundred dollars granted to the
defendant.</p>

<p class='c009'>At the trial, everything the law forbids
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>the police to do, is permitted to the
District Attorney. In his opening and
closing addresses, he exaggerates shamelessly,
and tries to prejudice the jurymen
with poison distilled from his own
imagination. For three months he will
be allowed to pour expert testimony
into the jury box. And by the way, if
a man is guilty, does it take a matter of
a quarter of a million and a quarter of a
year to show it? At this trial proper—or
rather improper—the caricaturist
with drawing-board, the jackal reporters—all
the cannibals of Park Row,
join in the man hunt. Nothing is sacred.
Old age, grief, womanhood, innocence
are but so much material for
the “story.” The official stenographer’s
report is a prosaic thing—away
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>with it. The defendant’s appearance,
his conduct—will be indeed a problem
for the readers of the penny dreadfuls—for
while the “Journal” describes his
eyes gleaming in their sockets like an
infuriated bull’s, the “World” chronicles
the tears which course down his
pitiable countenance, and the “Herald”
comments on his indifferent and callous
demeanor.</p>

<p class='c009'>But if the State has not proved me
guilty? the prisoner may ask. A fallacy,
my friend; in these days you must prove
your innocence. Of course the accused
is convicted. No man, however innocent,
can successfully combat the fourth
degree. Everything has worked like a
charm; but at last, after two years, perhaps,
or more, the case reaches the Court
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>of Appeals. Then the master stroke is
given, the <em>finesse</em> of which is startling
even to old criminal lawyers. That the
conviction has been obtained illegally is
universally admitted. How will the attorney
for the people induce the Court
of Appeals to sustain it? Of course, the
method will be in the nature of an innovation;
for the fourth degree is a new
thing, and just as certainly will it be
something unjust.</p>

<p class='c009'>Judging others by himself, the Able
Assistant will rely on the use of
money. Special counsel is obtained to
try to have the illegal conviction sustained
in the higher courts. A man of
national reputation, the leader of his
party, and noted for his political influence
and his willingness to use it;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>who, strangely enough, when high in
office appointed some of the judges who
are to listen to his argument, may be retained
to argue before the Court of Appeals,
and beg that it allow the conviction
to stand. The honorable special
counsel receives a great many thousands
of dollars for doing this, and in one case
had at last the opportunity of gratifying
a little personal grudge of nearly
twenty years’ standing. As the epitaph
of the Western man read, “He did his
damnedest; angels could do no more.”</p>

<p class='c009'>In one case I have in mind nothing
could equal this person’s eloquence
when arguing in the higher courts
<em>against</em> a new trial for the defendant,
unless it was his effort when, a few
weeks later, he insisted in a lower court
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>that the defendant <em>must</em> be tried again;
thus proving that there are two sides
to a case—the inside and outside.
Consistency is a jewel, a rare one in the
Criminal Court Building, County of
New York, for after all this fuss and expenditure,
the “good lady” who held
the office of District Attorney dared not
try the case, but left it to his successor.
All this is not an imaginary case; it is
my own. I know whereof I speak.</p>

<p class='c009'>Just consider for a moment another
case recently tried. Does it not furnish
further proof of the fourth degree?</p>

<p class='c009'>Two men were involved—one was to
be killed in earnest, because he had inherited
money; the other was nearly
killed with kindness to make the former
killing possible. The office had no case
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>against the first man. But they arrested
him; nor against the second man, so
they arrested him, also. The Assistant
District Attorney who prosecuted them
had a private practice while holding
public office. The charge against these
men was, that they had killed a third
man, who really died a natural death—an
old man who had money. Now began
the offers to each prisoner, separately, to
inform on the other. This always happens.
The result in this case was nil.
Both protested their innocence, but the
fearless prosecutor found the weaker-natured
of the two during these interviews.
It was the second man. To him
was offered absolute freedom—and what
else?—if he would say the other did
the murder. He did so. The examination
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>took place. There the other
proved the informer’s story a lie; he
proved a perfect alibi, which could not
be shaken. The legal adviser of the
people had employed—perjury. That
was the one thing proved. Circumstances
were now changed; that story
would not work. Remember there
were millions at stake, and the Able Assistant
had a private practice. So quite a
different lie was invented and sworn to
by the second man. This was also proved
to be a perjury, something for which
no prosecutor’s witness is ever prosecuted.
Still the first man, the legatee,
was held for trial.</p>

<p class='c009'>But during the long wait of years in
the Tombs for him, how did the second
man, the Assistant’s tool, fare? I said
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>he was killed with kindness. Of course
that is not literal; but the Fearless Prosecutor
took good care of him; he was
supplied with every comfort—no key
was ever turned on him.</p>

<p class='c009'>In return he subscribed to any and all
statements which were required to kill
number one. At the trial he made still
a different confession from the two
previous ones; the third one was that he
himself had committed the murder at the
instigation of the defendant. A self-confessed
murderer, a triple perjurer, he is
now scot-free, and an innocent man is
in the Death-Chamber.</p>

<p class='c009'>These are the methods of the fourth
degree. The Court of Appeals does not
approve of them; one District Attorney
has been removed from office by the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>Governor; but another, he of the ever-ready
biography, has handed them
down to his sons as an heritage of fame.</p>

<p class='c009'>The public has no idea of the enormous
number of cases which are reversed
by the Court of Appeals. Here
is a recent one. A young man was sentenced
to imprisonment for twenty-five
years by a General Session’s judge. But
the Appellate Division of the Supreme
Court, when reviewing the case, said:
“The defendant’s guilt has not been
proven. It is not even proven by the
evidence that <em>any</em> crime was committed.”
This is a fact, and any one who will
take the trouble to read the published
decisions will find it and many more
such instances.</p>

<p class='c009'>Of the convictions obtained by the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>District Attorney in the Court of General
Sessions, a small proportion of
the convicted men have money to appeal
to the higher courts, and the percentage
of new trials granted is high. How
much higher would it be if <em>all</em> cases
were appealed? In other words, think
of the poor devils who are in State
prison unjustly because of their lack of
money.</p>

<p class='c009'>There is a remedy for this state of affairs.
We have a legislature, a bar association,
and a legal aid society.
Among all these could not some arrangement
be made for inspectors, to
whom a man unjustly convicted could
complain and receive assistance? Is
there no relief or redress for the sufferers
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>from the fourth degree, when even
the third degree is forbidden by law?</p>

<p class='c009'>If the third degree is brutal, the
fourth is hellish. Call the third illegal
assault, and you must name the fourth
murder illegally designed. By means of
the fourth a gentleman can be hounded
to death by his enemies. In the third
degree a criminal has his ears boxed.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_0_7 c008'>The missionaries I have met!
Mind, I am not speaking of
the professional ones, those
who are officially connected with the
Tombs, or with Sing Sing prison; nor
the chaplains. Years of experience have
taught them their good work; they do
it properly and without the aid of trumpets.
Nor do I mean the ladies, who
out of the goodness of their hearts,
come and sing to us on Sundays. I am
referring to those kind creatures who
have made it their “life work” to come
here <em>occasionally</em> and bestow tracts and
cheering words upon us; the kind that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>carry enormous Bibles, full of colored
book marks, pressed against their flat
chests, and who punctuate their sentences
by rolling their eyes upward.
These book marks, I am convinced, are
what make them so round-shouldered.
They do not come during all the year:
with summer they receive calls, doubtless
from a celestial source, to “green
fields and pastures new”; while the real
helpers stay and, with us, bear the heat
and burden of the day.</p>

<p class='c009'>How I have been comforted by the
visitations (on <em>clear</em> days during the
winter, and <em>how</em> I have prayed for
stormy ones) of these devoted and
self-appointed examiners of my beliefs,
and by a perusal of the literature they
thrust upon me, “The Drunkard’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>Home” (this to me, who have never
tasted liquor in my life); “The Path to
Hell” (when I am there already); “A
Life of Sin” (I have always lived at
home with my parents). Still another
piece of literature informs me that I
may possibly be a Christian, but <em>not</em> a
<em>clean one</em>—if I smoke. Oh, the irony
of life! with all this abundant and excellent
supply, I am not allowed, while in
the Tombs, to shave myself!</p>

<p class='c009'>What a spiritual uplift I experienced
by the sudden appearance of a female
of uncertain age, who demanded:
“Where are you going to spend eternity?”
and before I could answer, “Not
with <em>you</em> if I can help it,” she put her
second question. “Do you pray, brother?
Do you get right down on your knees
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>and lift yourself up?” (wouldn’t that be
a stunt? it is also a mixed metaphor,
but what do missionaries care for
rhetoric?)</p>

<p class='c009'>On the first day of my incarceration
a good lady (she is also a type of all the
others) introduced herself to me in this
manner: Transfixing me with an awful
glance she said, “Man’s nature is <em>three</em>fold:
physical, intellectual, spiritual. I
am here to minister to your <em>spiritual</em>
necessities.” This she proceeded to do
by telling me to “look up, hope on, it is
brighter further off”; and that I was in
a prison cell—“for a <em>purpose</em>.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Hardly had she passed on and left me
happy in my solitude when her place
was taken by another, and then another,
who gave place to still another, all with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>the same tracts and expostulations. Not
one of them neglected to tell me, that
even St. Paul had been put in prison
(for a purpose, doubtless), and that John
Bunyan, although in a similar state of
durance, had written that great and
good book, “Pilgrim’s Progress.” Had
I ever read it? I pleaded guilty, and
was sentenced to read it again for my
own good. After several hours of this,
I also was in the mood to write—I wrote
this and to my mother—begging her to
come and sit in front of my cell all day,
and to bring a broom; but still they
came. My mother’s presence and the
absence of the broom but gave them the
opportunity to inflict her also.</p>

<p class='c009'>Oh, the missionaries! are there no bandits
in America? Why, oh why, do they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>insist on questioning me about my soul,
and offering to wrestle with my most secret
sins, when there is a man in the next
cell who needs underclothes? After
hearing the missionaries and being
promised another call on the morrow, I
wonder that the men do not rush to
the District Attorney’s office and accept
“pleas.” Sing Sing would seem preferable
to another visitation.</p>

<p class='c009'>I must not forget Sister “Goo-Goo,”
who is so sympathetic. She stands outside,
looking into my cell through the
barred door; she also looks alluring.
She sighs, then whispers, “This may be
your door of hope.” “Then why is it
kept locked?” I beg to inquire.</p>

<p class='c009'>Sometimes they come on Sundays with
last year’s religious papers and magazines;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>they come and gossip with the
keepers; or they bring a friend to whom
they show the sights and point out us
poor unfortunates. It is pleasant to
watch them as they meet and compare
dress goods patterns which they produce
from their pocket-books; how briefly the
hours go by, what brotherly and sisterly
love; how they enjoy themselves; how
happy <em>we</em> are while they do <em>this</em>.</p>

<p class='c009'>Of course we exchange experiences
when they have departed; and, good
souls, their visits often provoke some
humor in the gray days of our existence.
During the exercise hour one morning
I overheard the “hard” man tell another,
“her skirts” (that woman) “says
she is praying for me, but it won’t hurt
me none, for I’ve got an alibi.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>“See what the old ‘four-eyed gent’
just gave me,” said the wooden-legged
man. It was a tract on the sin of
dancing.</p>

<p class='c009'>“He’s all right,” cut in another, “the
old ‘polar top’s’ going to see the judge
about me and I’ll only get two years.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh,” said the lame man, “that’s
what the judge <em>intends</em> to give yer <em>now</em>;
after ‘the century plant’ talks to him for
three or four hours, the judge will give
you eighty years.”</p>

<p class='c009'>How the missionaries love each other!
few are on speaking terms; but must
they make <em>me</em> their confidant; do I not
suffer sufficiently? This is what I must
listen to, “That woman over there putting
her ‘stuff’ through the bars is one
of the very worst liars who comes here;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>you can’t believe a word she says. You
don’t want to have anything to do with
her; the less you tell her the better.
What do you think, she keeps the money
she collects for the poor prisoners.”</p>

<p class='c009'>My visitor goes and his place is taken
by the “friend” he has just eulogized.
“Did that man say anything about me?
Did you ever hear of his doing any good
for any one? He ought to be put out.”</p>

<p class='c009'>This good lady is followed by another,
her sister in the Lord. The second one
does not speak to the first; but she does
speak of her and imparts her social and
financial status. “Oh, yes, she’s very
wealthy; she could afford to do <em>much
more</em> than she does; she lives in a brownstone
house, and keeps three servants;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>but <em>I</em> have given everything I possess to
the Lord.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Oh, the cant! the cant one hears in
the Tombs.</p>

<p class='c009'>But there is another kind; there are
the real workers who bring gladness and
help; there <em>was</em> the “Tombs Angel,”
there is “Sister Sunshine,” and “Sister
----”; but it is of her I started to tell
this story. I heard it from a court
officer over in the Criminal Court Building
during my examination before the
Coroner.</p>

<p class='c009'>I was in the “box,” which means the
“pen,” that is to say, the “stall” in
which you wait till you are called before
the judge, and my friend the officer said,
referring to a very miserable specimen
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>in the opposite “pen,” who was in convulsions
by reason of his anger:</p>

<p class='c009'>“He’s the worst ever; the worst
ever I see; the very worst. Why, what
do you think? he cursed the Sister—what?
did I? Did I call him down?”</p>

<p class='c009'>The Sister he referred to is one of the
black-robed saints, who for the sake of
the lowly Nazarene devote their lives
to laboring among the sinners and unfortunates
in the city prisons. The object
of the keeper’s wrath was the toughest
man in the Tombs—to have that distinction
one must be hard indeed.</p>

<p class='c009'>The treatment which this particular
Sister of whom I speak had received
at the hands of the hard citizen was
somewhat as follows, according to my informant:
First, he had lied to her; then
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>he had asked of her an impossibility. Of
course she had attempted to do it. Of
course she failed; then he insulted her,
and what he said I am ashamed to write;
but tears were in her eyes when she
turned away. But for all that—wait, I
am ahead of my story.</p>

<p class='c009'>It seems that previous to this he had
abused his own lawyer until that worthy
would do little or nothing for him.
“Let him go. No one will help him,
anyhow—there’s no one who would be
a witness for him. He has no friends—there’s
no evidence that can save him,”
said his legal adviser.</p>

<p class='c009'>At the trial, which took place that day,
the day it stormed so, some evidence <em>did</em>
appear which proved him absolutely innocent;
never was this expected; it came
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>from an old enemy; he had not dreamed
this possible.</p>

<p class='c009'>How did this happen? She (the Sisters
hear much that no one else does)
had learned of this witness, and in spite
of the man himself and her own outraged
feelings, had procured his defence
and acquittal.</p>

<p class='c009'>“He didn’t deserve it, but then that
is just her way,” said my friend the attendant.
“Whose way?” I asked.
“Don’t you know? Why, God bless
her, I thought every one knew Sister
Xavier.”</p>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_0_7 c008'>Had I been the Governor of the
State of New York, I would
have pardoned “Shorty.”
There was universal sorrow in the
Death-Chamber when he died, for we
knew his story, and every one of us
felt that justice might have been satisfied
in another way. Each of us had
learned to respect this stupid-faced little
fellow of five feet one inch; who walked
with such heavy feet, and whose stooped
shoulders were the result of a long life
of excessive hard work, yet Shorty was
only twenty-two years old.</p>

<p class='c009'>On arriving among us, there was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>something very like an animal about
him. He could not read or write; he
learned to do both while there. Larry,
an Italian member of our guild, taught
him. At that time, when he was not
drawing pictures for “The Murderers’
Home Journal,” which the editor had
to suppress, he was catching flies; he
did this almost as well as a monkey—and
why not? How the flies loved
Shorty! But this was at first. So was
his feud with our colored brother, Benjamin,
which was renewed daily. Every
morning Shorty told Benjamin that his
face was black, and urged him to wash it.
Benjamin replied; Shorty responded;
Benjamin observed, and then the keeper
would interfere.</p>

<p class='c009'>What trivial things bring about misunderstandings
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>among friends. A mere
nothing at all will start a quarrel in the
Death-Chamber. We had cookies for
Sunday dinner, “the kind mother used
to make,” all dotted over with dried currants.
She gave them to me when I
was a good boy: she gave them to me
incessantly. Shorty replaced the currants
with dried flies, and sent them in
the twilight to Benjamin with his compliments.</p>

<p class='c009'>Benjamin was in a dark cell, it was
a dark day; Benjamin—my pen refuses
to write it. I shall never be hungry
again as long as I live, when I think of
what happened.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I doan think much of dem currants,”
said Ben.</p>

<p class='c009'>Shorty replied, “No-a-currant—heap
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>a—” My pen again refuses its task. No;
I cannot tolerate the thought, can you?
Don’t ask me to write that word, and
then I need not repeat Benjamin’s reply,
for Ben’s reply was <em>awful</em> to hear.</p>

<p class='c009'>This started the feud, and a little
pleasantry of Ben’s not long afterwards
added kerosene to the flame. Benjamin
bided his time. One evening he
challenged Shorty to a game of checkers,
for a paper of chewing tobacco a
side; best two games in three, the winner
to take all. Now in the Death-Chamber
each of us had made a checker-board,
and the squares of each board
were numbered alike; so, when an important
match is made, we can follow
the game as the combatants call off the
moves by numbers to each other. It is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>just like a chess match “by cable,” and
we are almost as far away from each
other, although in the same room. The
stakes were put up in the keeper’s hands.
Shorty won the first game, Benjamin the
second, Shorty the third, and took the
tobacco. Shorty was jubilant; he declared
that “Ben knew nothing from
the game what he is about.”</p>

<p class='c009'>It became strangely silent in Benjamin’s
cell. Benjamin was waiting until
Shorty should regale himself with the
victor’s spoils. For worlds Ben would
not have lost a word of Shorty’s remarks.
The noises which proceeded
from “little Italy” later were worth
waiting for. There were two dead mice
hidden away in the interior of that package
of tobacco.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>“How does yer like dem kurrents?”
asked Ben. “Doan yer be afeared to
chaw dem, dey’s perfectly ripe.”</p>

<p class='c009'>They were.</p>

<p class='c009'>No more presents were exchanged
after that. It is sad when friends lose
confidence in each other.</p>

<p class='c009'>Shorty spoke a language of his own.
It was English in sound and accent, but
the grouping of the words was according
to his own sweet will. For Shorty
the rules of syntax had no terrors.</p>

<p class='c009'>One day he told me his story. “I did
was from Italy six year. All the time
mostly work the railroad on. So much
big, heavy carry ties. That don’t make
me any never mind. I get the mon.
Ah! that is altogether something—three
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>hundred dollar. I will go home. Ah!
a prettyful of a girls is there to marry.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Then Shorty told me how he came to
New York to take the steamer. Here
he met some friend who invited him to
the Italian colony across the river in
Jersey.</p>

<p class='c009'>“He did went.” Every one said how
foolish he was. “Such a nonsense.
You don’t know what’s no good. You
talk like a nanny goat.” Why not
marry the beautiful daughter of the
house at which they were calling, “ain’t
yer”?</p>

<p class='c009'>The mother slipped away while the
father and friends argued with Shorty;
they were all so kind and convivial.
Yes, their new friend must marry Agnes.
The three hundred dollars should set
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>them up in housekeeping, the prospective
father-in-law, who was in “publitics,”
would obtain a brilliant position for
Shorty; only a fool would do anything
else. And then the mother brought in
the girl, dressed as every mother’s heart
would prompt for the occasion. Shorty
looked into her eyes; at the borrowed
plumage; he had, alas, already looked
into the cup.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah,” said he to me, overcome by the
mere remembrance; “Ah, there was
something not to believe it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Did you like her?” I asked.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You have good to talk, the same
thing is to me,” said Shorty, and there
was a sob in his voice.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then he went on to tell how the mother
took care of the three hundred dollars;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>how they, Shorty and the girl, signed a
paper; this made them man and wife, he
explained, and then they celebrated—“Maka
th’ congratulate.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Then came the tragedy. “It was one
o’clock after twelve—I feel awfully
worse—I don’t know what isn’t—I want
my wife,” explained Shorty.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You must be drink,” said the mother.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why don’t you say what you are
telling about?” cried the father.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I want de mon!” demanded Shorty.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Lie business!” screamed the father.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Throw away! No believe!” said
the friends.</p>

<p class='c009'>Shorty was trembling as he went on
with the story.</p>

<p class='c009'>“That’s a fearful, what I see? A
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>sharpa wire (stiletto). Ah, that is a
<em>different</em> something!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Shorty was magnificent now; no
words were necessary to tell the story,
his face and gestures showed me all that
happened. Tearing back his shirt, he
showed me a long, jagged scar from
shoulder to waist.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Quicker, quick into hall. Light no
more. What you have? It is to fight.
Right away quick off. Bigger man
throw down on me. They kill. I shoot—just
the same like this—<span lang="es" xml:lang="es"><em>Dio! Madre
de Dio!</em></span>—on the floor, the mother! So,
little, small hole in face. I do be arrested.”</p>

<p class='c009'>As the French say, figure for yourself
what justice poor Shorty received
at his trial against these witnesses and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>without his money—a paper man in
hell would get a fairer chance. So it
came to pass that Shorty arrived in
the Death-Chamber at Sing Sing, and
deported himself at first as I have described.</p>

<p class='c009'>But there came a time when Sister
Xavier brought him an Italian Bible
and catechism, and Larry Priori taught
him to read them. Then Shorty was a
different creature. He became a man—quiet,
considerate, industrious, and we
respected him. About this time came a
letter and photograph from Italy—from
home. They read the letter to Shorty—he
could not read writing as yet—they
gave him the photograph because it was
not a tintype. You may not possess a
tintype in the Death-Chamber. A man
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>once cut his throat with a picture of his
mother; they have been more careful
since. The picture had been taken by
a rural artist in some little mountain
town. Shall I ever forget it? On a gilt
chair—no, a throne—sat his mother in
peasant dress. I only remember that she
had on white stockings and congress gaiters,
and that the elastics on the sides of
them were worn out. She must have
weighed a ton, and evidently was frightened
to death. Perhaps the camera <em>was</em>
an “evil eye.” The father on one side
looked a hundred and fifty years old.
He must have toiled every moment of
it. Oh, the sister on the other side
of the mother, how hideous she is! But
listen: that the good saints might be
pleased to look with pity upon her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>brother at the other end of the earth
(the letter said this), his sister walked to
and from church every day—barefooted.
“It’s about eight miles away,” sobbed
Shorty. “Let me see the picture again.
It looks different to me now.” Shorty
wept; Shorty howled; Shorty prayed to
the picture. He covered the back of it
with soap, pressed it against the wall,
and knelt before it.</p>

<p class='c009'>Humor and agony are near neighbors
in the Death-Chamber. From Italy
had come one hundred dollars; all
his family possessed. This was to be
used in arguing the appeal. It was forwarded
to an Italian banker in New
York to Shorty’s credit. It was then,
and not till then, that Shorty’s brother
appeared. All Shorty had to do was to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>sign a paper. The brother had the paper
all ready, and the keeper brought
a pen. Well, I guess <em>not</em>! Have you
forgotten about the three hundred dollars
and the other paper Shorty signed?
Shorty hadn’t. While there was breath
in his body he would not sign another
paper. It was “lie business.” Then
the brother explained it all over again,
the keepers explained, and the “P. K.,”
meaning principal keeper, came with an
interpreter and explained many times
over that it was for a trial, lawyer; trial,
lawyer. “Don’t you see, Shorty?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Shorty stood with his short legs apart,
hands behind him, pipe in the corner
of his mouth, and eyes half closed, listening
to all they had to say.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>“Throw away lawyer,” remarked
Shorty.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, yes, Shorty, but he’d use it to
get you a new trial.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I had trial. See?” urged he of
small stature.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, no, Shorty; a <em>new</em> trial—<em>new</em>—<em>new</em>!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“They give new trial? Yes?”
Shorty was delighted.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t know,” said the P. K.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I wait,” said Shorty, and dismissed
them all.</p>

<p class='c009'>An Italian lawyer came, engaged in
a conversation lasting hours, which
sounded like a battle royal between ten
thousand enraged parrots; he departed
in tears. An Italian priest came, prayed
strenuously, and went away. The one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>hundred dollars remained in the bank.
Shorty would not sign a paper to save
his life. It’s bad luck to put your name
to a paper, <em>very</em> bad luck, indeed.</p>

<p class='c009'>In the course of time (a very long
time) Shorty’s case reached the Court
of Appeals, and the Court of Appeals
decided against Shorty. This made
Shorty furious. He explained that he
had been convicted again; that he had
not been present, an outrage; that no
witness had spoken for him; that no
one had “said the word.” Why didn’t
they send for him, for the witnesses?
Why? a <em>thousand</em> whys? No one was
ever able to make him understand.</p>

<p class='c009'>Again the brother came. Shorty was
going to the “good heaven,” he would
not need the one hundred dollars, but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>his “loving brother” could use it in his
business; would he sign the paper?</p>

<p class='c009'>“No! no—no!” said Shorty. Beads
of rich perspiration stood out on “loving
brother’s” forehead. “Loving
brother” had spent much money; there
was the Italian lawyer, the priest, the
carfare, the paper. Loving brother’s
grief was piteous to see. For the sake
of the dear <em>Dio</em>, would Shorty sign the
paper? No! no—no! Then Shorty
might go to the eternal bad place.
Loving brother left and came no
more.</p>

<p class='c009'>Benjamin asked Shorty why he did
not give the money to his brother.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No!” said Shorty.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What <em>in hell</em> is yer going to do with
it?” asked Benjamin.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>“No-a hell,” replied Shorty. “Heaven!
Go wash your face.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Larry’s time drew near. Shorty’s
chum and teacher was to go out through
the “little door” and be killed. How
Shorty prayed for him! But prayers are
not <em>always</em> answered in the Death-Chamber.
Larry said good-by to us and
departed; seven others have bidden me
good-by. And now there was no one
for Shorty to talk to in his mother
tongue.</p>

<p class='c009'>Shorty’s time drew near, the day was
fixed. Loving brother wrote to him,
there was much news in the letter. The
girl over in Jersey, whom Shorty always
spoke of as “my wife,” had married
another. The couple, her father,
and the mutual friends who had brought
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>Shorty to call so long ago and Shorty’s
brother were going to buy a keg and
have a picnic on a certain day, the same
day that Shorty looked ahead to on his
calendar, and— The picnic was to be
in honor of that event.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was just after this letter that
Shorty’s eyes went way back into his
head. Shorty ate little or nothing.
Those terrible prison lines began to cut
into Shorty’s face. Every day they
grew deeper, starting at the eyes, carving
furrows to each end of the mouth,
and extending to the chin. They divided
Shorty’s face into three ghastly
panels. Shorty’s skin was turning clay
color—and why not? Shorty will soon
be—dust. He got thin; you could almost
see through Shorty’s hands.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>Shorty prayed night and day, crawling
up and down his cell on his hands
and knees, kissing the floor, licking the
feet of the crucifix they had given him.
All night long, all night long he did this.
We who lay awake and tried to read
heard him mumbling as the beads
dropped through his fingers; heard the
tap, tap, tap of his forehead on the floor,
repeated hundreds of times before each
of the many pictures of the saints which
were stuck up on the walls. In front
of each of these pictures were little
fly-covered heaps of decaying food—Shorty’s
votive offering to the good
saints. The saints never accepted the
offerings, but the flies and roaches did.
They came by millions, flying and crawling
to devour it; they covered the walls
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>of Shorty’s cell; they covered Shorty.
The saints, in gorgeous crimson and
blue robes, with their mitres, crooks,
and uplifted fingers regarded Shorty.
Their eyes followed him about wherever
he knelt. Perhaps they will save
Shorty’s soul, but they do not drive
away the flies.</p>

<p class='c009'>Shorty’s brown knees came through
his trousers, the toes of Shorty’s slippers
turned up like cotton hooks from kneeling,
kneeling, all day long, all night
long.</p>

<p class='c009'>The priest noticed these things, heard
the account of Shorty’s nocturnal devotions,
and told him to stop them, for
he realized then—what we had known
long before—that the strain had been
too much for Shorty’s intellect—that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>Shorty was insane. But Shorty prayed
on, harder than ever. The good Sisters
and the priest did all they could to
moderate his devotions. During those
final weeks we noticed that they besought
him to do something; what, it
was a mystery to us. Finally the morning
came—the <em>last</em> morning.</p>

<p class='c009'>The priest blessed him, and as they
opened the cell-door in the early morning
for the last time, asked him, “Do
you forgive <em>your enemies</em>?” then pleaded
“you <em>must</em> do it. Say ‘<em>yes</em>,’ for <em>God’s</em>
sake say <em>yes</em>. You must, or God will
not—” The priest was weeping now.</p>

<p class='c009'>“<em>No! no—no!</em>” screamed Shorty, as
they marched him away.</p>

  <h2 id='ch16' class='c011'><i>CHAPTER XVI</i><br /> <br /><span class='under'><i><span class='small'>An Opinion on Expert Opinion<br />(with special regard to the testimony of Experts in Handwriting)</span></i></span></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_0_7 c008'>The law admits opinion evidence
by experts under certain conditions.
This is doubtless
right when such experts qualify as <em>specialists</em>
who have prepared themselves
by recognized methods regarding some
department of science, art, or industry;
and when their testimony is confined to
stating facts and deductions only, omitting
all abstract speculations.</p>

<p class='c009'>The admission of such testimony is,
doubtless, necessary. The fields of science,
art, and industry are enormous;
and in each, one man during one life
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>can only hope to acquire thorough
knowledge of one small part of his particular
enclosure. Hence “specialties”
have arisen—the one lifework of one
man. Specialties represent a movement
of “from the general to the particular.”
In the field of science, for instance, is
the department of surgery; and of all
kinds of surgeons is one particular specialist,
the dentist. So in art, music is
but a little part of all art, and the violinist
but a specialist in music. Industry
classifies into business and agriculture,
each in turn susceptible of innumerable
sub-divisions, each a specialty. By this
arrangement it is seen that almost every
man is to some degree a specialist, or
should be one; therefore, when particular
information is required it must be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>sought from the specialist. We seek to
appropriate his experience, and naturally
turn in our inquiry to those who
seem best qualified to supply our wants.
The true expert should be, then, a very
particular specialist. In the field of industry
and art we should require that he
be experienced and successful. In science,
that he possess definite knowledge—exactness.</p>

<p class='c009'>So far, no complaint whatever can be
made against the employment of experts
(specialists). It is a necessary
thing; it occurs every day in everyday
life, and their testimony is very properly
allowed in criminal and other court proceedings.
But it is undoubtedly wrong
when used unjustly; as, for instance, by
the State or a very rich man against
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>an opponent too poor to protect himself—and
the testimony of experts in
handwriting is often so used. It is especially
unjust when an expert on a scientific
subject holds no other commission
or diploma than one bestowed upon
him by—himself—an expert in handwriting
has no other.</p>

<p class='c009'>No one would employ a self-instructed
physician, retain a self-taught lawyer,
or a chemist who never went to school;
in fact, the self-educated are almost excluded
from the higher professions.</p>

<p class='c009'>Consider the formal course of study
necessary to become a physician, a
minister, or lawyer—schools and all
their examinations, the four years in
college, and all the examinations pertinent
thereto, and then the special post-graduate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>courses at schools of law, medicine,
or divinity. We trust and respect
these professions, because we know of
their preparation; this is their guarantee.
They are tested over and over again to
see if they can do their work. Only then
do they obtain diplomas. We require
this very thing from our engineers, firemen,
coal miners, and accountants before
they are granted a license. But the
handwriting expert passes no examinations,
and possesses no diploma. He
need not even procure a license.</p>

<p class='c009'>The expert in handwriting may have
your life, liberty, and fortune in his
hands; but he comes from—where?
Who taught him? Who has tested or
examined him as to his knowledge and
accuracy? Think of it! The right to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>swear away the life, or liberty, or property
of another is bestowed upon this class
of “experts” by themselves. And the law
permits it. Where do this class of “experts”
study their “science”? What
school has classes or lectures on this
subject? What college has a chair for
the instruction of experts in questions
of disputed writings? Is there a university
with a department for their training?
What does Harvard, Yale, Princeton,
Columbia in America, or Oxford
and Cambridge in England, have to say
on this subject? All scientific things
are recognized by these great colleges
and universities. The study of questions
arising from disputed handwritings is
recognized in none of them; hence this
study is not, at least as yet, a science.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>Another reason why this study is not a
science, is that it is based on the theory
of probabilities; it is mere speculation.
For this reason experts in handwriting
cannot even agree together on their own
specialty. They lack the unity of even a
trade. Experts in handwriting have no
guild—no society. Why is this? Because
this class of professional witnesses
can never formulate their conflicting
theories; they cannot agree on any one
point; they have no common standards,
no principles laid down and agreed to,
no mutual foundation or basis for their
theories to rest upon. Again why? Because
they would have to violate them
in the very next case into which they
might be called. Therefore experts in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>questions of disputed handwriting are
not scientists.</p>

<p class='c009'>In courts of justice no experts should
be allowed to plead (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>ex-parte</i></span>) for the side
they espouse. Experts in handwriting
are notorious for this; and their methods
and deductions are always according to
the testimony desired by the side retaining
them. Their opinions are tinctured
by retainers. In many cases where
large sums of money are involved
in litigation, as, for instance, a disputed
“will case,” experts in handwriting
appear on each side. The question
in such cases often narrows down to
the simple proposition: “Is the signature
of the last will and testament genuine?”
It must be either genuine or
forged; and yet we find the phenomena
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>of prominent experts in handwriting
holding diametrically opposite views,
and giving reasons under oath in support
of their opinions. Now it naturally
follows that if one side is right, the other
side <em>must</em> be wrong, and <em>vice versa</em>; the
signature cannot possibly be both genuine
and forged. If the testimony of <em>all</em>
the experts is in accord with <em>conscience</em>,
some experts are—to be charitable—inaccurate.</p>

<p class='c009'>The expert in handwriting can seldom
be coaxed into a position in which he
can be <em>proved</em> wrong. Really it is
extremely simple. Is the signature of
the deceased so exact that no one would
dare dispute it? Not he! The expert will
declare it a tracing should his retainer
dictate; otherwise <em>not</em>; but whichever
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>way he testifies he can never really be
<em>proved</em> wrong, at least in this world, since
the one who could tell has passed away
to another. Under the circumstances, no
wonder the expert can afford to be very
positive.</p>

<p class='c009'>In criminal cases these experts affect
the side of the prosecution. Is a conviction
secured? It is the result of his
skill, while in case of an acquittal, he
protests that justice has been cheated,
and the prosecuting attorney never fails
to indorse this view. He dearly loves a
forgery case. If retained by the prosecutor,
that official will protect the expert,
and have witnesses to corroborate his
opinion; while, should the defence secure
his services, the expert’s opinion
will be corroborated by the defendant
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>himself. The only thing which will <em>prove</em>
the expert in error would be a confession—an
unlikely occurrence.</p>

<p class='c009'>But disputed writings, disguised, and
anonymous communications are his joy,
and again it is almost impossible to
prove him wrong; and again his work is
very simple. In these cases the guilty
man, whoever he may be, never comes
forward to admit his crime, so that the
expert can blame whom he pleases or,
rather, whom he is paid to blame. It
is simplicity itself—similarities are to
be pointed out. It is self-evident that all
writings must contain similarities, for
were there no resemblances the art of
writing would be useless. In fact, that
one person can read another person’s
writing, is based on this principle.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>Surely it is just because we all do make
the twenty-six letters of our alphabet
more or less alike, that we can read each
other’s writing at all. In such a case the
<em>dissimilarities</em> (and they are in all writing)
will be regarded as attempts at
disguise. And, since all writings must
consist of similarities or dissimilarities,
either or both will be argued as proof
against a victim of this kind of evidence.
To sum up, their art is to offer
a theory favorable to the side retaining
them, in such a manner that it may be
believed or doubted, but which cannot be
disproved.</p>

<p class='c009'>Another question regarding this class
of experts is, do they keep their oath, “to
tell the truth, the <em>whole</em> truth, and nothing
but the truth?” If engaged by the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>prosecution do they disclose the points
favorable to the defendant—no matter
how apparent? Never. Although under
oath to tell all, they are advocates for one
side only. They are always positive, they
swear to their opinions; but are they accurate?
Suppose they should be tested,
examined with writings of known and
living persons, and knew nothing of the
circumstances of the case, and had no
District Attorney to warn and protect—suppose
some one tried to fool them—a
child could do it!</p>

<p class='c009'>The law limits all opinion evidence.
It is not considered as good as testimony
to fact; much has been written on the
justice of so doing. Judge Woodward in
“The North American Review” for
October, 1902, has treated the subject
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>from a legal standpoint. In this article
referred to he shows in no uncertain way
how the opinions of experts in questions
of disputed handwriting are regarded by
bench and bar, especially in the higher
courts. Moreover, he cites many instances
of injustice done by this kind of
opinion evidence. Beside this, I believe,
there is a justly popular prejudice against
this particular kind of expert testimony.</p>

<p class='c009'>I have tried to show that this opinion
evidence—expert testimony in regard to
questions of disputed handwritings—is
less accurate and has less authority than
the opinion of other specialists. If this
is true, should it not be limited to a
greater extent than all other kinds of
expert testimony? And to this end I
venture to propose the following: That
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>a commission be appointed to thoroughly
and exhaustively examine all so-called
public and official experts in handwriting.
No thorough and conscientious expert
would object to being tested as to
his qualifications. Licenses should be issued
to the successful candidates. (Few
“sheepskins” would be needed.) Such
a license should be required before the
expert can practise in court.</p>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_0_7 c008'>There are unwritten laws and
canons for all important occurrences
in the Death-Chamber.
I do not mean the prison rules;
but the way “we” have of doing things.
For instance, the new arrival, after he
has passed through all formalities at the
officials’ hands, and they are many, is
initiated by “us” on the first night
passed in our society.</p>

<p class='c009'>This is an ancient and honorable custom,
and like all initiations, a secret.
These fixed ceremonies occur all
through his long and brutal life in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>Death-Chamber.<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c015'><sup>[1]</sup></a> Long, for even a
short stay in it makes him old; brutal,
because his punishment is—death. Is
that not enough? And to add thereto
years of solitary confinement is to kill
him not once, but over and over again.
The system is all wrong. Oh, the years
in the Death-Chamber! The loneliness,
the quiet. Hell must be a quiet
place.</p>

<p class='c009'>When at last it is drawing to a close,
when the Governor has refused to interfere,
the officials proceed in this manner:
On Saturday the “fortunate one”
on stepping from his bath is ordered
into a new cell—the one next to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>“little door” leading to the execution
chamber. Here he receives everything
new: new bedding, new clothes
from head to foot, and then his knick-knacks,
pipe, tobacco, boxes, books, and
the packages of letters from home, ragged
and blurred from reading and rereading;
all have been very carefully
searched. He receives something else,
for this change in itself is his notice that
one week from the following Monday
he will be moved again. No questions
are ever asked; he has seen it all before;
but should he ask, the only reply will be,
“I don’t know.”</p>

<p class='c009'>From that moment a certain unwritten
etiquette among us is never violated.
His own way in everything, as far as we
can possibly comprehend it, is our law.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>Does he ask for a song or story, his demand
is acquiesced with at once. Will
he play checkers? He may choose his
opponent, and he will always win. We
send him our oranges, the top layer
from the box of cigars one has purchased.
We do anything, everything
we can to please him. Has there been
a quarrel between him and another,
it is completely forgotten. On his part,
he must make the ghastly regulation
jokes during the week. These are two
in number, one with the keeper about
the new suit of clothes: “I suppose <em>you</em>
will be wearing this week after next.”
Number two is with the barber: “Don’t
forget to cut my hair short on top.”
From now on the “death watch” (two
keepers) sits in front of his cage every
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>night. During this week occurs the
greatest horror we are called upon to
bear, <i>i.e.</i>, to hear the last farewells of
our companion to mother, wife, sister,
or child. While listening to their
cries we anticipate the agony in store
for those <em>we</em> love. My heart bleeds
when I remember what I have heard in
the Death-Chamber. It is unspeakable.
I cannot write of it.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then comes the last night. Everything
must be done very exactly now.
Our code prescribes for everything;
nothing must be omitted, no custom
may be violated. The early evening
passes as usual. Generally he asks for
songs, perhaps he will sing one himself.
That is as it may be. But at midnight
the last rites among us of the Death-Chamber
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>take place. The keeper comes
to my cell carrying, perhaps, the little
paper box my departing friend has kept
his tobacco in so long; one that he made
and decorated himself.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Keep that to remember me by,” I
hear from the direction of the little door.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Thank you,” I reply.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Good-by. I hope you have luck
and get out,” is the next part of the
ritual.</p>

<p class='c009'>I must respond, “Thank you. Good-by,
and God bless you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>This is repeated with each one separately.
He gives everything away,
books, pipe, all. For six months he
has been turning over in his mind just
what treasure each of his companions
shall receive when the last night comes.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>The responses never vary. They are
now as they were ten years ago; they
will be the same twenty years from now
if that hell on earth is still in existence.</p>

<p class='c009'>No one speaks to him or to any one
else after that. He is reading and rereading
each of those letters for the last time
and destroying them. We hear him tearing
them up one by one. “Swish, swish,
swish.” Then it is quiet, very quiet in
the Death-Chamber. I am not sleepy;
the other fellows do not seem to be
sleepy. They are reading. I sit up and
write this; to-morrow I will write the
other half.</p>

<h3 class='c016'><span class='under'><i><span class='small'>The Next Morning</span></i></span></h3>

<p class='c017'>I have often read in the newspapers
the supposed meal partaken of by the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>departing guest “furnished from the
Warden’s table.” No newspaper reporter
seems able to resist a description
of the last breakfast, and no two
papers ever publish the same one. Did
the wretch gorge himself to the extent
indicated, indigestion and not electricity
would carry him off, and justice be
cheated. No, he is not even stimulated
to the extent of a cup of coffee, and for
a good reason; a full stomach is not a
good conductor. You will read that
“the man was indifferent.” I tell you he
was glad to go. “That he made no
trouble.” Why should he? “Our horror,”
how we are affected by our companion’s
death, is portrayed. As a matter
of fact, we envy him. Anything,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>everything is better than existence in
the Death-Chamber.</p>

<p class='c009'>During the night, if you have lain
awake, and one has been known to be so
foolish, you may have felt a very slight
vibration, perhaps it is imagination; perhaps
it is the dynamo. If you have slept,
and do not hear the death-watch draw
down the curtains in front of all the cells
when the night outside turns gray, you
will surely be awakened by the noise of
many feet. It is the priests who have entered.
Their ordinary shoes on the
flagging of the corridor sound like thunder,
thunder moving away. Now it subsides
to the murmuring of Latin prayers.
As you lie in your cell (the drawn curtains
make it resemble a little box) wide-awake,
you know that the last confession
<span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>is being made, the last sacrament is being
administered. This is another reason
why no breakfast is given to the traveller.
I saw it all one morning; the curtain was
not quite down to the floor. I made
myself as flat as possible. I saw the
priest bless and kiss him; hold up the
cross before his eyes; bid him have faith,
and then back out of the cell. “He,”
who is so soon to be “it,” followed.
Then I heard the procession march
rapidly into the next room. “Bang!”
said the hungry little door as it closed.</p>

<p class='c009'>What happens in there, and how it felt
three minutes later, I cannot tell you;
but I came very near finding out. Will
you believe me that this day is a long
one? <em>You</em> fellows outside can do much
to divert the mind from disagreeable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>thoughts; <em>we</em> have breakfast, and sit
down to wonder which one of us will be
the next to go. Poor Benjamin, you
have the advantage of us now; you have
found “Nirvana” while we are worrying;
you are reposing in your bed—of
quicklime.</p>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_0_7 c008'>I listened for the shrieking whistle
of the milk train. It has come
and gone, and the echoes have
died away among the hills of Ossining,
those beautiful hills, just—outside. The
little family of sparrows who live in the
skylight of the dead-house—I know each
one by name—awake and angrily pipe
their protest at the disturbance. Some
of them fly down into the stale, tobacco-laden
air and hop on the floor looking
for crumbs.</p>

<p class='c009'>I can hear Shorty, at the other end
of the corridor, in the last cell of all,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>talking to himself, or to God. Others
are mumbling while they doze. Larry
shrieked twice during the night. And
I? I received a visit yesterday and
have lain awake thinking over the incident
and of what the future means to
me.</p>

<p class='c009'>I am morbid!</p>

<p class='c009'>I have made the story of the little
dead mouse—it is all imaginary, but it
is what I have resolved to do myself
if----</p>

<p class='c009'>All these are signs not to be disregarded;
I know something is about to
happen; I lie in bed and watch for it.
Outside, I know that nature is cool
and gray—delightful. I wait; it comes.
The fierce yellow light begins to fade
from out the electric globes; and finally,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>as it becomes less intense, each little red
wire is visible; which fades into pink and
disappears. The fearful light, the cruel,
torturing, piercing light is gone. And
that is how dawn comes to us in the
Death-Chamber.</p>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_0_7 c008'>It is said that everything is relative.
A fixed period of time, for instance,
is either long or short, according
to circumstances. There is an
exception to this rule. Time is always
long while the jury is out. Be this period
eight hours or six minutes in duration,
either constitutes a life-time. I
know, for I have experienced both.</p>

<p class='c009'>To a man whose brain is analytical,
here is a splendid opportunity to administer
to his mind some of its own medicine.
While the first jury considered
my case I noted my impressions in my
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>little red diary, for, thought I, this is
a road over which few travellers pass;
it is really a unique experience, an episode
in a life. I will record my impressions.
That jury was most considerate;
it did not hurry me in the
slightest; it was out eight hours. I
started to record my impressions while
the second jury deliberated; it interrupted
me in six minutes—but I have
forgiven it.</p>

<p class='c009'>Here are the thoughts which came
to me during the period at the end of
my first trial; but before I quote from
my note-book—it will be unnecessary
to open it, for I shall never forget what
is inside—it may be of interest to know
the circumstances under which the entries
were written.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>My trial for murder is almost over.
The evidence against me has all been
given—there was none offered in my
defence, for technical reasons. The
closing arguments by counsels have
been made; the judge has charged the
jury, and the jury is out. My fate
rests upon the knees of the gods. All
of which means that I am in a little iron
pen, and that twelve men occupy the
next room, deliberating whether life or
death shall be my portion. I am very
tired; for full three months I have been
under a physical strain and a mental tension—I
have been falsely accused, I am
innocent. There are three who know
this—myself, the man who did the murder,
and God.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>February 10, 1900. The first entry
at 3.30 o’clock <span class='fss'>P.M.</span></p>

<p class='c009'>The keepers are watching me curiously.
Their trained eyes are like
microscopes, through which they study
and compare my conduct with that of
previous defendants whom they have
guarded under similar circumstances.
They are calculating how long it will
take for me to break down and show
nervousness. I think they have a bet
on the subject. It is irritating. If I
should ask for a drink of water, they
would exchange glances. I must not
throw away my cigar before it is quite
smoked up, neither must I let it go out—for
these are bad signs. No laughter
on my part, even should something impress
me as being amusing—it would
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>sound “forced.” And, above all, no
blowing of the nose, even if I want to.
They will suspect a surreptitious use of
my handkerchief for another purpose.
Any one may guess, and very cleverly,
at mental agony expressed through
physical distress. But what if there are
no visible signs of distress? There shall
be none. I wonder how they will interpret
my occupation of writing this?
If they imagine I am making my will
they must think me possessed of much
to give away.</p>

<p class='c009'>I have speculated about my guards
and answered their kind inquiries. I
am killing time; the afternoon is slipping
away quickly. At any rate, the jury
cannot stay out much longer. I look
at my watch—eight minutes and a half
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>have passed. Good God! Only eight
minutes and a half!</p>

<p class='c009'>The second entry at four o’clock.</p>

<p class='c009'>I am chemist enough to love an experiment.
The jury is the unknown
substance; the testimony, the reagent;
my case is in solution; what will precipitate?</p>

<p class='c009'>I think of the judge’s charge. I can
repeat it word for word; it is seared into
my brain; but it would have been more
cruel had it aroused a false hope. How
did it impress the jury? Over and over
again, the old question cries out in my
mind: “What will the jury do?”</p>

<p class='c009'>You may be sure I selected pleasant-faced
men; men with little fans made of
wrinkles at the corners of their eyes;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>men who smiled often; who had pleasant
voices.</p>

<p class='c009'>What a change comes over a talesman
when he becomes a juror! He is
sworn. He takes his seat in the box;
he will hold your life in his hand; you
cannot get rid of him. Now you look
at him in this new aspect, and there is
a leer about his mouth, a cruelty in his
eyes you had not seen before. Why
did you select him—a man with a jaw
like that? It was suicide.</p>

<p class='c009'>I think of the prosecution’s case.
They will convict me, of course. I reconsider
it from my point of view. No,
they cannot! No jury in the world
could convict on such theories. But on
what will they base an acquittal? There
was no defence. I remember the surprises
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>the district attorney’s office has
sprung upon me—the unanswered witnesses,
the fervent experts swearing to
the impassioned hypothetical questions
of the prosecutor, and his closing address,
scathing, unjust. There is no
chance for me—the odds are thousands
to one against acquittal.</p>

<p class='c009'>Even so, whispers Hope, that happens
every day. Think of the lotteries—the
odds in them are many thousands to
one against the winning ticket; but one
ticket <em>must</em> win. There can be no—That’s
it! “The reasonable doubt”!
But there has been no defence. It is
hopeless. Then the presumption of innocence?
Ah, they will disagree; I
know it, I am sure of juror number ----;
I shall have another chance; but what
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>will the jury do? Perhaps they will
exonerate me.</p>

<p class='c009'>The third entry: 5 o’clock.</p>

<p class='c009'>I have gone over the merits of the case
again, coolly, dispassionately. I have
counted the points against me on the
fingers of my right hand, and checked
off the points in my favor on the left.
I shall be convicted is my conclusion.</p>

<p class='c009'>How will they take it at home—my
mother, my—Stop that! <em>Stop that!</em>
You are not to speculate on that subject;
there must be no redness about
the eyes, no twitching mouth when you
face that jury for the last time. Use
your brain—think of something else.</p>

<p class='c009'>I am sick of the case; it can have but
one issue. I must drive it from my
mind by some other subject. I must
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>have a proposition to prove—anything.
Why does time pass so slowly? for instance;
that will do.</p>

<p class='c009'>It <em>is</em> going slowly. This afternoon
is a life-time—but why? That is a very
good subject; it is an intensely real one.
That this afternoon is “a life-time”
is not only figurative—it is literal.
Think of it; as long a life-time as you
will, is composed of what? Of course
I mean mentally—not what happens;
that is hardly worth chronicling. What
constitutes our interest in life? Surely
it is because we cannot tell what the
next day—or the next moment, for that
matter—may bring forth. We hope,
but uncertainty gives that hope its zest.
Because we cannot discount the future,
the unexpected is life, and life is Doubt.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>Can enough doubt be crowded into a
few hours, or even minutes, to constitute
a life-time? You will know it possible
if you have ever waited—while
the jury is out.</p>

<p class='c009'>This must be the secret of the drama—the mimic
life—in which the aroused
hopes and fears and sympathies are but
other names for doubt. Imagine, then,
the suspense, the doubt, of the waiting
man in this play with real life or
death, and concentrate the emotions
of a whole audience into that single
brain.</p>

<p class='c009'>The fourth entry: 6.30 o’clock.</p>

<p class='c009'>There is a noise in the street below.
I look out of the window at the crowd;
they are waiting also from curiosity.
Newspapers are being sold—newspapers
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>full of unjust and imaginary stories about
me and mine. The journalists are eager
to sell these inventions while interest in
my case lasts, hence the newspapers are
“extras.” While watching this I see
the jury go to dinner in an old-fashioned
white stage, such as used to carry passengers
on Broadway. Perhaps it is the
same stage in which I rode with my
mother to Manhattanville thirty years
ago—I a little fellow in kilt skirts and
white stockings. How well I remember
it!</p>

<p class='c009'>The fifth entry: 8 o’clock.</p>

<p class='c009'>They will allow no one to see me; that
is, none of my friends, but curious officials
come in on imaginary errands to
look me over. The jury returned some
time ago; they have now deliberated for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>five hours. Evidently some one is holding
out. Having done so for this length
of time, it looks like a disagreement; unless
some one changes his mind. Why
should a juror change his mind? He
has sworn to go by the evidence. Do
the opinions of his companions change
the evidence?</p>

<p class='c009'>I wish that there was no jury system.
Having five judges to preside would be
much better. They would go by facts,
their ears would not be tickled by mere
eloquence; experience would teach them
when witnesses were lying. And, best
of all, five judges would know the real
value of expert testimony; yes, they
would know that, for they would hear
the official experts expounding one theory
to-day, have heard its opposite yesterday,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>and will hear the repudiation of
both to-morrow.</p>

<p class='c009'>The sixth entry: 8.30 o’clock.</p>

<p class='c009'>They brought me sandwiches and a
cup of coffee. While disposing of them
I talked to my friends the keepers, telling
them about my experiences in the
cattle business so long ago and so far
away. They paid me the pretty compliment
of saying that I take matters
more coolly than any one they had ever
seen; that I show no emotion—I knew
they were watching for it. Am I confident?
No, I am not. Strange to say,
I am becoming indifferent. After all,
what does it matter so far as I am concerned?</p>

<p class='c009'>Like the stag making his last stand
and being torn by the hounds, better die
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>than escape wounded to suffer more;
better have it over and done with. And
as for my home, my family—stop
that!</p>

<p class='c009'>The seventh entry: 9 o’clock.</p>

<p class='c009'>The refinement of cruelty. I have
been taken into the court-room twice;
each time with exposed nerves which are
scraped and singed by the questions the
jury has come in to ask, and the answers
which push me nearer to the
edge of the precipice. Each time I have
gone prepared for the end. It is interesting,
but not amusing. I saw my
father last at two o’clock, seven hours
ago. He has grown seven years older
since then. My brother is in court.
He is four years my senior; he looks an
old man—I wonder how I look. My
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>attorneys are very serious as they whisper
together.</p>

<p class='c009'>The eighth entry: 10 o’clock.</p>

<p class='c009'>Three months I have been on trial;
twice a day I have been taken into court—morning
and afternoon. The signal
which summons me is made by rapping
a key on the iron door. This is symbolic—key
and door. Which way will
the key turn? Will the door open or
close for me? I feel that the next summons
will answer these questions. They
are rapping the key on the door.</p>

<p class='c009'>The last entry: midnight.</p>

<p class='c009'>I was right. I found out about the
key and the door on the third summons.
It is <em>not</em> three times and—<em>out</em>.</p>

<p class='c009'>I entered the yellow room. It was
packed. Every one turned to look at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>me. It was a picture of a storm at sea;
the pale faces were the whitecaps. It
foreboded trouble—shipwreck. A little
strain of music had run in my head all
the afternoon—“The Blessing of the
Poniards,” from the “Huguenots”—a
full orchestra seemed to play it then; I
marched to it.</p>

<p class='c009'>We sat down and waited for the jury.
While doing so this thought intruded itself
upon me: Had I the gambler’s fever;
would “wheel” or “bank” ever interest
me again after this?</p>

<p class='c009'>Imagine becoming excited over a hundred
dollars placed on the red or black!
Of what concern would be a little white
ball running around and tumbling into
holes; or cards, two at a time, being
drawn from a silver box; or, for that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>matter, five pasteboards held in my own
hand?</p>

<p class='c009'>The jury entered; they would not look
at me. I knew. The judge entered;
we all rose to show our respect—for
his gown. He looked pleased; he must
have known the verdict as well as I.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The jury will rise.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The prisoner will rise.”</p>

<p class='c009'>What luck! The chimes from the
“New York Life” building, around the
corner, struck eleven. Yes, so it proved.
“New York Life” was bidding me good-by.
The gentlemen of the jury had
agreed upon a verdict. They found the
prisoner guilty of murder in the first
degree.</p>

<p class='c009'>There was applause from the <em>judge’s</em>
chambers; a woman’s voice cried out,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>“Oh, good! Good—good!” A window
opened and I saw a carrier-pigeon
flash out and fly away. All this to
the accompaniment of a groan which
ran around the court-room. One
woman—God bless her—fainted; and
then I felt my father’s hand in mine.</p>

<p class='c009'>The game is over, and I have lost.
I must be a good loser, for the crowd
in the corridors cheered me—cheered
a convicted man on his way to the
“Bridge of Sighs.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Then I was under a compound microscope.
Convicted men seem to be interesting
men; at least, not one of those
unwinking eyes would have missed a
single tit-bit of my agony had I displayed
any. But plain, vulgar pride
came to my rescue; for I had seen convicted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>men carried back to the Tombs,
undressed, and put to bed like sick babies;
I had heard them howl all night
and beg for liquor; some of them had
tried to throw themselves downstairs.</p>

<p class='c009'>But my mother, my—stop that! For
God’s sake don’t think of that; perhaps
later, in the dark----</p>

<p class='c009'>We crossed the “Bridge of Sighs.”
We stepped into the prison yard, flooded
with moonlight. It was like the last act
of “Romeo and Juliet” among the
tombs. Poor, mad Romeo! I thought
of other moonlit scenes; of another
Romeo; of love vows never to be renewed—that
is, I started to think of
them—something I must not do. It
was all the fault of the queen of night.
I had not bathed in her mysterious light
<span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>for twelve long months. (It was three
years before I worshipped her glory
again.)</p>

<p class='c009'>Never in my life have I been so
touched; never so near breaking down,
as when, on that night, the keepers in
the Tombs, where I had lodged so long,
expressed to me their sympathy and confidence.
I believed in their sincerity
then; I have never doubted it since.</p>

<p class='c009'>Next morning.</p>

<p class='c009'>I went to my little cell; and, with my
best philosophy, undid the chattels I
had packed so carefully that morning
and addressed to home. I slept. What?
Sleep? Certainly. There was no more
suspense; I was legally dead. Life
had stopped with its forfeiture; relief
had come from doubt. I slept. It
<span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>proved my proposition of the afternoon.</p>

<h3 class='c012'><span class='sc'>The Second Jury.</span> Nov. 11, 1902.</h3>

<p class='c017'>The jury sitting at my second trial has
retired, and three years later I find myself
under almost precisely similar circumstances
to those just described. I
will note the variations. The suspense,
the doubt, should be worse than at the
previous trial, knowing, as I do, what it
is to be a convicted man, and what it
would mean to go all through it again.
I know it, all the way from the ceremony
of passing the death sentence to the
opening of the little door.</p>

<p class='c009'>Strangely enough, that same strain of
music hums in my brain, repeating itself
over and over again. I do not believe I
have thought of it once during the last
<span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>three years. Yet, here it is, and I shall
march to it again.</p>

<p class='c009'>What will the jury do?</p>

<p class='c009'>I do not think about my case this
time; if acquitted, I shall be pleased for
my father’s and mother’s sake. If convicted,
as far as I am personally concerned
I am absolutely indifferent. I am
like a man who, having fallen from the
roof of some sky-scraper, lies mangled in
the street below. Suppose an old friend
comes along and kicks him? He cannot
feel it because his back is broken. I can
suffer no more whatever happens; and I
have forgotten how to rejoice.</p>

<p class='c009'>Acquitted, convicted—I am indifferent.
Since that night I watched the
dawn come to the Death-Chamber, as
God lives, I have not cared.</p>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_0_7 c008'>I found myself in the Death-Chamber;
others were there. Our small
community being an American institution,
we were all “free and equal,”
of course with the exception of the former.
Unhappy, indeed, would be the
life of any one in that room who did not
recognize this equality.</p>

<p class='c009'>But most of my fellow citizens refused
to exist in the present. Making of the
Death-Chamber a half-way house, they
alternately lived in the past, or died in
the future; and they were perfectly logical
in doing so; it was quite excusable.
Our existence there was certainly not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>life, and it was not nearly as comfortable
as death. So they brooded, and the
Death-Chamber is a bad place in which
to brood. Some of my companions
acted very foolishly when those long,
hot, humid summer days arrived.</p>

<p class='c009'>Here, then, was a problem. I must
learn to amuse myself, I must cultivate
my own acquaintance; I must make
friends with my own identity. This was
not difficult, for we possessed a mutual
friend—a close, personal, dearly intimate
friend. One who had been with
me in the mines of Mexico and on the
alkali plains of Texas. Together we
had paced the white decks of yachts
in summer; had spent the evenings in my
library, and the days in my color factory
in the winter. A friend, who, by special
<span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>permission of the warden came to live
with me, to share my degradation.
Wasn’t he a good fellow? I consulted
my friend: I have always done so. I am
consulting him now, for I am smoking
my favorite pipe. The introduction
took place, was accepted on both sides,
and I formed the acquaintance, and
afterwards friendship, of my own Imagination.</p>

<p class='c009'>My new friend—I hope you will meet
him some day, if you have not done so
already—taught me to “penetrate the
veil,” to look right through and beyond
and above all conditions. I cultivated
the friendship of Imagination still further,
and the whole earth and its fulness
became mine. No one could sentence
my thoughts to imprisonment, they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>were free. I began to live mentally.
It was my birthday.</p>

<p class='c009'>He counselled me not to waste those
years. “What an opportunity!” he said.
So for twenty months I devoured books
from the prison library. No telephones,
or duns, or bores could interrupt me;
there were no social duties, no business
to interfere. I read, I dreamed, I improvised.
Then it was but a step to
writing, and I must say Imagination was
very nasty about that. He made me
review my grammar with diligence. To
satisfy him, I had to study rhetoric anew.</p>

<p class='c009'>He opened my eyes. The Death-Chamber
was full of—<em>life</em>. There was
Romance, Tragedy, of course; and even
Comedy looked in through the skylight
and set me laughing now and then.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>Material was all around me; stories
about the Death-Chamber came into my
mind so quickly that I could not write
half of them down; they sprang up and
choked me, where before had been only
barren land. I set down the least horrible,
for some—yes, many—could not
be printed; and if you have found these
grim or out of line, it is because of environment
and of their truth.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then Imagination and I went away
to England. We wrote a novel. In
it are no prisoners and no crime, but
it is full of the sea, brave men, a cruel
woman. It is a tale of love.</p>

<p class='c009'>Imagination is a humorous fellow—he
must have his joke. He made me
interested in things dramatic; he advised
the purchase of everything I could hear
<span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>of on the subject—text-books, essays.
I bought two hundred plays, and he
and I went to the theatre every evening
at eight, and attended matinées on
Saturday at two. Just one play each
evening, and after the curtain fell we
talked it over and criticised—we analyzed
those two hundred plays—Imagination
and I. We laughed at costume
comedies, studied the plays of social
life—from Sheridan to Fitch—and
delved for motives in the modern problem
plays; watched Mansfield, Drew,
and Sothern in all their rôles. Over
Cyrano de Bergerac and L’Aiglon we
poured the tribute of a tear to Rostand’s
genius.</p>

<p class='c009'>And then (how did he keep from
laughing in my face?) Imagination
<span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>egged me on into writing plays—many
of them. If he made me think the “actable,”
he well deserved the name.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was all my own fault: the smoke
from my older friend often got up into
my eyes and warned me. This old pipe
of mine played the cynic and was perfectly
frank about my dramas. But I
wouldn’t listen. I blundered on until
I found a “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>fidus Achates</i></span>” to help and
guide me. Together we hope to restrain
this strenuous fellow a little.</p>

<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c009'>It’s all over now. My pipe, Imagination,
and a faithful friend, I have
found them all, and I “found <em>myself</em>”
in the Death-Chamber.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_0_7 c008'>It was bludgeon against rapier which
began yesterday; it was the battle-axe
against the stiletto; it was Osborne
against Molineux; and Molineux
won.</p>

<p class='c009'>Never, I think, was so dramatic a duel
fought out in a court-room. There was
very little noise. The surface of it was
quiet as a pool. The casual observer
would have seen merely two men—the
one in the witness chair and the other
lounging against the lawyers’ table—who
seemed to be exchanging polite commonplaces.
They were courteous. Now and
again they smiled at each other, with polite
<span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>amiability. They “mistered” each
other. Yet underneath this unrippled
surface was a tremendous tragic depth, in
which they clutched and struggled, fierce
and silent. It was a fight for life. For
Molineux it was life and honor—or the
throttling shame of the electric chair. For
Osborne it was either a vindication of his
methods as a prosecuting officer, or it was
bitter defeat. He was fighting for his professional
life as truly as the haggard prisoner
was fighting for the breath of life.</p>

<p class='c009'>Never again will you see such a battle
waged—so tense, so watchful, so merciless.</p>

<p class='c009'>Molineux, to be sure, came pallid and
wasted from the cell where they have
shut him up for nearly four years. He
had the look of one of those mouldy men
who creep up into the sunlight now and
then from the cellars of the world. But
no sooner had he taken his seat in the
witness chair, no sooner had he faced his
adversary, than the race showed in him.
He threw back his prison-worn head and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>squared his shoulders; he set his jaws until
his thin lips made a straight line, like
a sabre gash, across his face. He was
ready; every nerve and ounce of brain in
him was alert. He was ready to do battle
for his life. The apathy and sluggishness
of the cell-dweller fell away from him.
In this supreme moment he was almost
the man he had been before they arrested
him and put him away.</p>

<p class='c009'>As for Osborne, he was flushed, savagely
earnest. His eyes blazed whether he
would or not, and every now and again
he smote his great red hands together.
The joy of battle was upon him. Such
joy the Apache knows when he sights his
enemy; such joy must have stirred the
gladiator when he rushed into the arena.
To be sure this exaltation did not last
through the day, but for a few hours it
added zest to the duel.</p>

<p class='c009'>Just such a mob as should have watched
this duel gathered in the court-room.
Heaven knows where they came from—these
<span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>women with out-of-date clothes and
pendent earrings; these perfumed girls
with slashing hats and equivocal eyes.
They crowded in, guarded by fatted municipal
underlings; they filled one-third of
the court-room; and all day, like cigarette
girls at a bullfight, they chewed sweetmeats
and craned and whispered and
grinned. Then there were those who had
business there—that honest, white old
man, General Molineux, unwavering in
belief in his “boy,” for one; for another,
there was Harry Cornish—gray from head
to foot this one. He was dressed in
gray; his gloves were gray; his very face
was gray, and the eyes in his deep-lined
face were the color of ashes. All day he
sat watching the prisoner with swift, furtive
glances; watching the reporters;
watching the audience; always watching,
watching.</p>

<p class='c009'>There was never so observing a man.</p>

<p class='c009'>What of Molineux? He made an excellent
witness. He gave an impression of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>utter sincerity. Perhaps this was due to
Mr. Black’s admirable examination. Perhaps
it was due to the fact that he was
telling the truth. In any case, he scored
heavily. The jurymen nodded approval.
Had the case gone to them last night they
would have given him—beyond all doubt—the
key of the street. Molineux, too,
looked content.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Assistant District Attorney began
slowly. Round-shouldered, stooping a
bit, in an ill-fitting new coat, with red face
and prognathous jaw, he stood for a moment
staring at the prisoner. His eyes
were burned out as though from lack of
sleep. Molineux straightened up in his
chair and joined his hands in his lap.
Evidently he was summoning all his resolution
and all his self-possession. At last
he was face to face with the man who for
nearly four years had bent every energy
of his fierce nature to the task of destroying
him; of blackening his home, and
branding him with the red mark of murder.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>And this he knew would be the
fiercest assault of all—the final one. He
was on guard.</p>

<p class='c009'>They crossed swords very ceremoniously
at first. Beneath all the politeness
there was, on one side, a deadly and savage
earnestness; on the other was the
wariness of the man whose back is to the
wall and who fences for his life. And yet
how suave they were! They might have
been rehearsing the amiable history of
Gaston and Alphonse. It was “Mr. Molineux”
and “Mr. Osborne.” One almost
expected the “My dear Mr. Molineux”
and “My dear Mr. Osborne.” And so,
with a curious, almost artificial smile on
his red and heavy face, the great Apache
of the District-Attorney’s office began.
He wanted to know about the divorce
case.</p>

<p class='c009'>“How old were you, Mr. Molineux?”
he asked.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Fifteen, Mr. Osborne,” was the answer.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>Mr. Osborne looked painfully shocked;
just so a man might look should he be
arrested as a burglar while making a midnight
call upon a friend.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Fifteen!” he repeated. “And the
husband was a dear personal friend of
yours, was he not?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Molineux acknowledged that he knew
the husband. The prosecutor nodded
significantly to the jurymen. They, being
men of the world, and some of them bull-necked
men of the world, did not seem to
take it very seriously. Molineux seemed
rather ashamed of it. Osborne, however,
would not let go. Three times he went
over it, as a woman wipes a dish, turning
it first on this side and then on that. At
last the good gray judge wearied of it.</p>

<p class='c009'>“He’s already answered all that,” he
said quietly.</p>

<p class='c009'>Osborne flashed up like gunpowder.
All the savagery in him showed in an instant.
It was as though a bulldog had
shown his teeth. He took a step forward
<span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>toward the bench and half snarled, half
shouted:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Your Honor, I can’t cross-examine
this witness if you interrupt me like that!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Jerome clutched his assistant’s arm
and tried to quiet him, but Osborne shook
him off. Justice Lambert looked at him
and smiled his enigmatic, up-the-State
smile.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I will interrupt you, Mr. Osborne,”
he said, “whenever I think it necessary.
Now go on.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Osborne went back to his place and
drank a large glass of water. That soothed
him, but for the rest of the session his
nerves were out of tune, and then the
burden of politeness lay heavy upon him.
Then for a little while he questioned the
prisoner as to his knowledge of chemistry.
Molineux admitted that his attainments
were fairly good. He knew of it all a
paint maker need know.</p>

<p class='c009'>So far Osborne had been defeated
all along the line. The defendant had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>answered every question unhesitatingly
and with engaging frankness. He had
parried every thrust, even that deadly
lunge of his fifteen-year-old co-respondent.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Assistant District Attorney seemed
to think in lumps. He jumped backward
and forward in his cross-examination in a
way that would have baffled an ordinary
witness.</p>

<p class='c009'>Never once, however, did he lead Molineux
into a quagmire. Osborne sat down,
drank a glass of water, and whispered to
Jerome. While his adversary sought for
a new weapon, Molineux turned and
looked through the green-shaded window.
For an instant the alert air of self-possession,
the look of the ready swordsman,
fell away from his face. The old, weary
prison look crept over it. It was as
though a mask had slipped from some
tired dancer’s face. He looked haggard,
yellow, old. As he turned he saw, just
over his head, the cruel Roman symbol
<span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>of vengeance—the faces and the axe;
saw, too, the calm women who spin the
thread of life, crouching on the shadowy,
frescoed wall, a naked skull at their feet.
Something seemed to grip his throat. He
strangled a moment, then he coughed and
spat. With a sudden gesture he drew his
hands across his eyes and pulled himself
together. Osborne’s burnt-out eyes were
fixed on him. At that very instant he had
himself in hand again. From that moment
he never for a second lowered his
guard. His attention was persistent as
the pull of a magnet. His will was like
steel. He shunned every quagmire and
escaped every pitfall with marvellous dexterity,
and with seeming unconsciousness
that he had passed the peril by.</p>

<p class='c009'>He is an extraordinary man. The brain
in him is first rate. His intelligence is
high above the average. Withal there
seems no insincerity in him. He was
fighting for his life, but he talked as
calmly as though he had been in a drawing-room.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>Not only did he answer every
question, he went out of his way to volunteer
information. He answered questions
to which his counsel objected until
Mr. Black said: “Oh, well, let him answer—let
him tell everything.” And it
was this very frankness that at first confused
and finally baffled the great Apache
of the prosecution. Moreover, his courtesy
was charming. When Mr. Osborne
floundered in the midst of an intricate sentence
the defendant would help him out.</p>

<p class='c009'>Gradually this told upon the Assistant
District Attorney’s nerves. It is difficult
to bully a polite, accomplished man, and
Mr. Osborne’s successful cross-examinations
have always been those in which he
banged the witness about the ears with a
bludgeon. An hour before the usual time
for the adjournment of court he had had
enough of it. To his ill-concealed discontent
he was told to go on with his
cross-examination. He shifted from subject
to subject, playing, as it were, round
<span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>the case. Always the little prisoner met
him, cool, efficient, ready. At last, upon
the insistence of District-Attorney Jerome,
an adjournment was granted. Mr.
Osborne went away to furbish up new
weapons for to-day.</p>

<p class='c009'>Molineux stood up. He glanced at the
jury. They were whispering together.
Evidently it had been a good day for the
defence. The rapier had mastered the
bludgeon. And as he stood there, waiting
for the jailmen to take him to his cell and
lock him in, his father came up, a smile
on his careworn, tragic face, and laid one
arm around his neck.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am proud of you, my boy,” he said;
“proud of you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>That was bravely said. It is easy
enough to be proud of a son who wins his
way in the world and gets honor and fame.
It is finer, perhaps, to be proud of the son
who carries himself well in the hour of
black shame and peril; who can bear himself
well even though the next day may
<span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>send him to the electric chair. What was
he proud of, the old fighting man? Of
the good blood, perhaps, that flows the
steadier the greater the danger is.</p>

<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c009'>For fifteen fateful minutes Molineux
was on the stand this morning.</p>

<p class='c009'>Assistant District-Attorney Osborne
had spent the greater part of the night
preparing for his promised attack. He
had assured the court that he would occupy
two hours in probing the pallid little
man who stands charged with murder.
He promised a sensation.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Osborne has something up his sleeve,”
said the lawyers.</p>

<p class='c009'>The spectators buzzed it among themselves.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Osborne has something up his sleeve!”</p>

<p class='c009'>And so he had; but it was only his
arm. The expected did not happen. The
sensation did not materialize. And yet
Molineux could not foretell this when he
took his seat in the witness chair and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>clasped his nervous hands upon his knee.
He was cold and white and firm; watchful,
too, for Osborne faced him with an
air of savage concentration.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was the crisis of the trial. It was
the crucial moment. It was the crossroads,
whence one path led to freedom
and the other ran darkly away to shame
and death. Molineux knew it. Osborne
knew it. They eyed each other like men
who are to meet in the death struggle.
The Assistant District Attorney was evidently
nervous. He moistened his lips
with ice water and wiped his forehead with
a handkerchief. Then he threw one leg
across the table in his free and easy way
and leaned forward. Having failed by
direct questions to tangle the little prisoner
in the net, he attacked him indirectly—and
not very chivalrously—by dragging
in the name of that unhappy woman who
is now Molineux’s wife. Of course, from
the viewpoint of a prosecuting officer, all
is fair in law. It is fair to help a witness,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>fair to throw mud at a woman—even
though she is outside the case and aloof—but
it is not always wise. In a low
voice he began questioning the prisoner.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Did Barnet pay any attention to your
wife?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c009'>Molineux’s face hardened. He brought
his jaws together; a glimmer like that of
steel leaped into his misty eyes; but that
was all. He answered the question quietly
enough, but it was evident that the introduction
of his wife’s name touched him
on the raw. All that was chivalrous in
him came to the surface. And in spite
of the fact that he was rusted in prison
for four years, there is still a deal of chivalry
in him.</p>

<p class='c009'>He admitted that Barnet had paid many
attentions to Miss Cheeseborough in the
days before he and she had become betrothed.
It was another indirect way of
getting Barnet into the case and of insinuating
a motive for murder.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Did you give your wife an engagement
<span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>ring?” the Assistant District Attorney
asked.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“When?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I should like to explain that, Mr. Osborne.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am not trying to entrap you, Mr.
Molineux,” said the prosecutor, sweetly,
“but suppose you answer my question.
Wasn’t that ring bought November 18,
1898—one week after Barnet died?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“There were two rings,” said Molineux.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then he told the story of the ring. It
was a strange romance to listen to in the
stifling home of crime. It was like a lily
blooming in a pesthouse. As Molineux
told it his voice softened into wonderful
tenderness. He did not look at Osborne.
He did not seem to see the jury or the
crowded, morbid court-room. He was
living again the days of love.</p>

<p class='c009'>“There were two rings,” he repeated.
“One was a mizpah ring—like this one,”
and he drew the ring from his finger.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>“My mother gave this ring to me long
ago. I have always worn it. Miss
Cheeseborough admired it, and I gave her
one like it for a Christmas present.
Then, when we became engaged, she said
that should be her engagement ring—she
would have no other. But when we came
to arrange for our wedding she decided
that the mizpah ring should be our wedding
ring. It was sentiment,” he added;
“it was her wish. And so I bought the
second ring, of which Mr. Osborne has
just spoken.”</p>

<p class='c009'>All this was said very simply. There
was, however, such pathos in the voice,
so fine a sincerity in the face, that the
effect upon the jury and upon the audience
was extraordinary. It was the first
time that Molineux had shown his heart—he
held it out for the Assistant District
Attorney to peck at. And there was a
pause. Mr. Osborne fumbled his papers
and hesitated. Then he asked a few unimportant
questions, which did not mask
<span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>his defeat. Abruptly he sat down. The
famous duel had been fought and lost.
Molineux had outpointed him at every
turn. For a while the Mad Mullah of the
District Attorney’s office sulked, refusing
comfort. In vain Jerome hugged him
round the neck and patted his shoulder.</p>

<p class='c009'>It has lasted fifteen minutes. In that
time the case was virtually tried. Osborne’s
last attack was not his best. The
Apache who goes out for a scalp should
not loiter by the way to throw stones
at a woman. So far from helping his
case by bringing in Mrs. Molineux, he
hurt it.</p>

<p class='c009'>Osborne’s attack upon the prisoner’s
wife paved the way for his most telling
defeat. It opened the door for Molineux.
It permitted him to recount the romance
of the ring. It gave him an opportunity
to show that there was more in him than
a keen and wary brain—that there was a
heart. And that went home to the
jury. All the world loves love, and a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>juryman is like the rest of us—part of
the world.</p>

<p class='c009'>He gave Molineux his opportunity, for
the man who defends a woman is always
in the right.</p>

<p class='c009'>And he used it superbly. There were
no heroics. There was only the story of
the ring. There was only romance. There
was only a hint of true love and an old
love story. That was all, but it turned
the truculent prosecutor’s attack into utter
defeat. Osborne knew it. Molineux
knew it. The great cross-examiner’s
promised flaying of Molineux had miscarried.
Had Osborne been retained for the
defence he could have done no more for
the pallid little prisoner. He flung himself
into his chair and sat there, gulping
ice water, mopping his red face.</p>

<p class='c009'>The prisoner kept his seat in the witness
chair.</p>

<p class='c009'>Governor Black arose. His hands in
his pockets, a smile on his face, he looked
at his client.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>“I have no questions to ask,” he said
cheerfully. “That is all, Mr. Molineux.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The prisoner went back to his accustomed
place. The old father got him by
the hand. They laughed softly as they
gripped hands. The little prisoner was
years younger than he was two days ago.
His eyes looked human and bright. At
last he could see the sunlight shining. He
and hope were together again. His lawyers
shook his hand again and again. The
old General whispered to him, proud and
happy. It was as though the case was
already won.</p>

<p class='c009'>And it all happened in fifteen minutes—in
ten minutes—in five minutes—while
Molineux was telling the story of the
ring.</p>

<p class='c009'>A better witness never took the stand.
Unguided, without a single interruption
from his counsel, he foiled the great
Apache of the prosecution at every turn.
If he did not win his case, it is because
the case is past winning. He won, at all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>events, the sympathy of the swarming
spectators. He impressed, in any case,
the wearied jurors.</p>

<p class='c009'>Again it was rapier first and bludgeon
second.</p>

law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project

  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project

  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of

  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
