      <h2 id="who"> Who is Mate Verunica? </h2>
        <p> I am a aspiring computer science student as well as
          a huge soccer fan. If I am not in the "dungeon" working
          on a project you will find me on the soccer pitch. Some
          of my favorite past times include 5am red bull induced
          coding marathons as well as the occasional gaming ;)</p>
     

      <h2 id="history"> My Professional History </h2>
      <p> During the summer of 2015 I worked for Opus Stewart Weir as
      a database administrator as a summer student. As well I worked
      in the IT department for the Law Courts in Edmonton, during the
      summer of 2014.</p>
      <h2 id="skills"> What Can I Do ? </h2>
      <p> I am very proficient in database design and architecture. I
      also know many programming languages such as python, php, java,
      C, C++, HTML, CSS, Lisp, Prolog. I am always looking to learn more! </p>
